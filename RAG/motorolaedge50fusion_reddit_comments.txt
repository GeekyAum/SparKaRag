did you update to android 15 ?

2025-06-10T05:57:28Z
To get this sot and android default ui just disable battery care app

2025-06-10T05:52:49Z
I don't why but this SoT feature should be available on all moto devices irrespective to model& region.

Suggest some aesthetic theme for my 50 fusion ...

2025-06-13T11:43:34Z
It is an online game so the lag would be up to your cell service

2025-06-13T11:54:12Z
7s gen 2 is made by samsung so yrah heating issue ü§°

2025-06-20T09:06:21Z
If updates are a necessity for you, don't switch to edge 50 fusion. For all the other requirements I would have definitely switched to edge 50 fusion.

2025-06-20T10:16:00Z
Fusion.

I know speed wasn't your issue, but funny you started with charging. 68w vs 30w makes a huge difference. 

I'd really struggle to go back after having faster charging, it really is a game changer.

2025-06-20T16:29:06Z
The edge 50 fusion by far

2025-06-21T05:32:12Z
Neither, get 60 pro/60 fusion. Also wait for 60 neo.

2025-06-21T05:45:46Z
The 50 fusion is a good alternative, and although the G75 promises updates for a longer time, I don't think it is the most important feature, if you want many years of updates there are the Google Pixel or Samsung, plus Motorola can change plans from one moment to the next. And it is almost certain that custom ROMs will be released for the 50 Fusion, after all, Motorola's software is almost Stock. Vi que comentaste sobre la pantalla curva, en ese caso puedes ir por el Edge 50 neo si est√° a tu alcance..

2025-07-07T02:36:23Z
I updated to Android 15 and although in its first versions it did have some problems with battery life, it currently behaves very well and is very stable with the May 2025 security patch. I have not had to do a factory reset.

2025-07-07T11:25:12Z
I updated a short while ago and didn't have any issues. Last night, I was trying to sign in to an app and it kept crashing. I cleared the cache, deleted the app, and restarted my phone multiple times. I checked for updates and everything was up to date. Finally, I checked if there were any Google Play System updates and it said to restart my phone, which I did. Everything has been ok so far.

2025-07-06T21:19:38Z
Update if you are willing to do a factory reset and reduce the chances of errors

2025-06-14T15:57:29Z
Just get 60 fusion for u and 50 neo for your wife.

2025-06-14T13:49:54Z
Cmf/Nothing phone are also good, but these are just huge giant sized.         
There are no ads on Motorola phones, there's just a new weather app that has ads, but this must be disabled. and you will automatically get the Moto weather back, which has no ads.   
Don't forget that the 50 Neo has a smaller battery.  I don't like curved displays either, not practical.

2025-06-14T20:59:45Z
surprisingly, 50 fusion does not feel bigger in hands compared to 50 neo, IMO

2025-06-14T21:03:05Z
Well just to start out no one ever buys a Motorola for their camera performance

2025-06-16T10:50:21Z
Can anyone confirm if the edge 50 neo can switch lens while recording at 4k30? if it does can anyone dm me a video of it switching lenses in a video

2025-07-01T20:11:07Z
Well cant say much about legal and social as they are within their policy and the consent you tick at the phone startup about warranty policy. 

And this seems to be an issue with most Moto devices. My edge 40 and G84 died the same way, When I went to the service centre they told me it would take 14500 for the edge 40 and 8500 for G84. 

So i just went to a local reputed repair shop he charged me 2k and told me that only a few ICS were burnt because of the Power surge and one connector with the battery was broken, Also water vapour was inside both the phone even though they are IP68 rated and it was peak summer season; all that took around 3 hours to him while the moto service doesn't even check and change the whole motherboard. 

I will suggest you try a local person.

2025-07-01T22:19:05Z
This happens all the time with appliances, computers, TV's, all cell phones,, etc., doesn't matter who makes them; devices/appliances can fail at any time while under warranty and after the warranty expires. No there's nothing you can do about it legally or socially, it's just a fact of life.

2025-07-01T21:44:53Z
Move to Europe where phones die exactly two years and 20 days after purchase.

2025-07-06T10:59:52Z
Have you tried Lock Screen, Privacy, Don't Show Notifications At All?

2025-06-26T04:41:55Z
we need edge 60 neo ffs

2025-06-26T04:24:17Z
Hopefully it's an Edge + 2025 edition.  That would be fantastic.  My Moto Edge + 2023 is an outstanding phone but would be awesome if a new Edge Plus is launched

2025-06-26T04:45:28Z
I have been using an Edge 40 for 2 years (curved display) and it has not given me any issues yet. It has survived some falls as well.

So it doesn't become "sh!t" just because you don't like it. Nobody is forcing you to buy it at gunpoint.

2025-06-26T05:10:06Z
For some reason I read first "Another Cursed"

2025-06-26T05:59:52Z
what are you on about? the only company making curved phones anymore is motorola with the edge line. dont like it dont buy. there is plenty of other options.

2025-06-26T04:19:59Z
They're amazing tho I don't get the issue lol

2025-06-26T09:25:46Z
Hey just putting it randomly here. I'm thinking of buying the Edge 60 pro and while researching I saw many of you hate the curved display. As for me I've always wanted to buy a curved phone since S7 edge came out. So what are the problems that might occur using these displays? (Imagine I never drop my phone)

2025-06-26T10:26:25Z
Looking for "Moto Edge 60 Neo" with flat LTPO display, new chip, larger battery and better camera system. This would be the best midrange ever!

2025-06-26T11:46:38Z
My 2 cents on the curved screens, and maybe someone can convince me they are good now. I had a 2021 edge plus and currently have a 2022 edge plus (US naming, I know we are different from everyone else). I did like the 21' but the screen seemed cumbersome, I disliked when content goes past the curve, and cases did not fully enclosed it due to the edge (only phone screen I have broken in the last 10-15 years, due to a 1ft fall into a wooden bedframe corner, case did not help because of how it landed and no glass screen protector because only the film type was available for this phone). Overall not a fan. Mostly love the 22', only gripe is the stylus needs a specific case that falls apart quick, already have gone through 2 of the them and gave up. 

I have been waiting for another flat screen non-foldable phone from moto to consider upgrading, but some of you seem to really like the curve, I don't get it, but maybe someone can tell me why it is superior.

I have had probably 10 moto phones now, going back to the OG Droid, which I dearly miss the slide out keyboard, and the Moto X which may have been the peak of Motorola engineering, design, features and customization.

2025-06-26T06:06:40Z
Does "Flipkart Unique" mean that this phone will only be available in India?

2025-06-26T07:58:52Z
But I like my 40 Pro

2025-06-26T09:14:35Z
At least Motorola could of gave us an update on that shit battery for the moto g stylus 2025 but instead they release another edge phone only for India

2025-06-26T10:36:14Z
I really like the Motorola Edge+ 2023 it has a curved 165hz display. I haven't wanted to upgrade to the newer Edge models yet.

2025-06-26T19:51:29Z
fr, except stylus all are curved, who tf is pitching these curved designs.üò≠üôè  
waiting 3 months for a flat screen, still no luck

2025-06-27T07:09:42Z
And no aluminum frame this time either! Cheap plastic and cheap leather.!

2025-06-27T22:19:44Z
curved phones are AWESOME and you can't convince me otherwise. they're superior in every aspect. don't tell me about durability cuz they're still so sturdy

2025-06-28T07:46:52Z
I don't understand what is their obsession with curved displays! They are very difficult not to break! They are not convenient in typing, in accurate video display as it warps at the edges and bends the picture, they have glare at the edges due to light, games are difficult to play when the options are at the curves, they are expensive to repair and replace, they are easily damages in just one side drop on the floor... 

Brands want people to pay more for the repairs, and also with faulty updates they ruin the display drivers causing green lines glitches, camera quality, performance, battery issues, boot loop etc... Overall we are heading towards bad phones! Because brands have hired hackers to ruin the phones systematically with bug infused updates.. They are greedy and in a rat race to become rich..

2025-06-26T07:51:17Z
Means now moto edge 60, 60 pro, 60 fusion....all gonna be fucked up in terms of updates üíÄüòÇ

2025-06-26T08:11:00Z
Motorola Edge 60 Neo probably

2025-06-26T09:50:57Z
I love the curve! Period!

2025-06-26T19:06:52Z
Thank God Samsung stopped doing aggressively curved phones, the only thing it does, - is makes harder to install screen protector.

2025-06-26T21:08:43Z
I hope it's the edge 60 ultra

2025-06-27T07:11:57Z
Always wanted to get the 2023 Edge+ model, but Motorola never launched it here, in India.

2025-06-26T05:45:32Z
What ? You guys brand your own product as SHIT Lol...

2025-06-26T06:19:00Z
We only use EDGE here, very good image.

2025-06-26T07:57:15Z
im gonna sell my 50neo to get the 60neo if it comes with the curved display lel, flat is kinda boring tbh

2025-06-26T05:15:46Z
Man I hate it, I've got the Edge 30 Ultra and I'd never get a phone with curved edges again, it's *incredibly* useless.

2025-06-26T12:43:02Z
I'm dreaming about a Edge 60 Ultra ü•≤

2025-06-26T15:32:04Z
What a shame this company is! With all the problems users are experiencing, lack of tracking and updating continue to release new models. It costs them less to release new models rather than paying a good developer for software updates and monitoring... It proves the quality of their products which even in the ads show waterproofing problems while they sell this same model as ip69 lol. I've never seen that in my life

2025-06-26T10:15:15Z
saar we want headphone jack saar we r og saar flat display saar moto beat samsung saarrr

2025-06-26T04:37:58Z
No more Motorola phone!!!

2025-07-08T19:48:07Z
Moto G04/G04s are experiencing real software issues related to the newer Google System Update from 1st June. Like, all the phone sensors have stopped working after that update and it's been a headache to use the phone. I have a Moto G04s and I'm really frustrated since it's my first phone purchased from Motorola. I just hope Motorola does something since I really like this phone

2025-07-09T06:43:46Z
Turn off Ram boost, and the live caption feature. I don't know what its exact name is, but when you control the volume it appears below it, and this ugly. I turned it off.   
Disable and delete the new 1Weather/Weather app, because then the real Moto weather will appear which is the best.    
Delete disable Live lock screen app, and also Moto app manager. this downloads random games for you.   
I also disabled hidden Meta apps.    
You can turn off your Motorola from collecting datas about you. for example for ads. or to improve Moto phones, if there is anything. or Idk, but I turned off spying.    
You can use private DNS in your Wifi settings, and there will be no ads in the apps. (there will still be ads on Youtube)

2025-07-08T19:41:37Z
Bro can i get the Wallpaper that is in your moto edge 50 neo.

2025-07-08T20:39:42Z
Hey there from another Motorola family! We have Motorola G85 for the teen, Edge 30 Neo for my partner, and I've got an Edge 50 Pro. They're all working well for us. I can't speak for the others but mine hasn't slowed down or anything, and it's had at least one major Android upgrade.

Mine is caseless but the other two both have the stock cases without any problems.

2025-07-08T23:30:41Z
Hey I have that same case on the left but in black on my moto G84!

I've had it for about a year and the performance has stated consistent.

2025-07-09T02:09:17Z
Software support is spotty
EOL haste is.. well...
Bugs are indeed to come across 
"Motorola service center" visits are HELLA EXPENSIVE

2025-07-09T05:35:35Z
G04 and G14 were such great value with their ufs 2.2. It was alittle too good the G05 and G15 reverted it back to emmc

2025-07-09T06:28:57Z
Bro, in the lock screen why don't you change the clock style to the nice kind?

2025-07-09T08:43:52Z
What is your phone case for edge 50?

2025-06-12T04:42:57Z
I guess it'll take 6 months or more?

2025-06-12T13:36:14Z
Still waiting for A15, edge 2024...

2025-06-12T12:07:26Z
The list is worthless... Motorola didn't deliver Android 15 to half the devices they announced would get it.

2025-06-12T15:54:44Z
You might see it when android 18 comes out.

2025-06-12T04:26:43Z
Is there any whay that we can apply for beta

2025-06-12T06:17:57Z
Those who are going to be missing out on the Android 16 update, actually you will not be missing out on much.

2025-06-12T10:57:54Z
I knew that the G85 was also included, but from what I see I don't think so

2025-06-12T11:34:45Z
Excellent we wait and hope thanks

2025-06-13T05:32:18Z
I'm happy with Android 15 on my G85 but hope Android 16 will be an option.

2025-06-13T08:09:09Z
No info on deployment dates?

2025-06-13T10:50:23Z

Edge 50 Neo is promised for 5 major OS updates, let's see how long that goes.

2025-06-13T19:46:43Z
I still haven't got Android 15 and there is already a list for Android 16

2025-06-13T21:01:55Z
Thought I read it wrong cuz I'm still waiting for Android 15, let alone 16 lol

2025-07-07T16:41:52Z
Bummer. I just got the 23 and it upgraded to 14 on the first day and the next day i got 15... Was very surprised. Not counting on 16 though.

I did exactly the same you did (from Poco X5 Pro 5G to Moto Edge 50 Fusion), but mainly because of the annoying "feature" present in Xiaomi MIUI/HyperOS that makes all notifications disappear from the lock screen after unlocking your phone, and also didn't like the way notifications are handled in the status bar. Nevertheless, I never had any issues with ads because I debloated the phone.

Regarding tips, I would recommend removing certain bloatware packages from the Motorola OS for a smoother operation (you can easily find guides here and searching online).

2025-06-30T02:41:26Z
That's the same phone as me :)
Same colour too, hope you enjoy it. 

My suggestion if it's shipped on Android 14, instead of installing all updates on the phone one by one (which mucked my device up), use Software Fix on a PC and just restore it straight to the newest update (which is Android 15 - May 2025 patch).

AFAIK, Amazon is not an Authorised Store for Moto in India 

it's either motorola's own website or Flipkart.

most likely a reseller is selling Moto phones on Amazon.

2025-06-30T02:47:27Z
Which Poco phone are you switching from? Edge 50 Fusion is on the lower end of the Edge series, so your multitasking experience may vary. It is still a good phone though.

2025-06-30T06:29:11Z
Good make over indeed...

Moto is just simple, no heavy skins and BS apps in it though...

2025-06-30T10:35:28Z
Was a Moto fanboy till they released green lines on my pristine Edge 30. Clowns at service center said, water damage. Looked online, they had messed up a lot of the Edge 30s in the APAC region. 

Good luck buddy!

2025-06-30T11:38:00Z
Haha same here. Switched from Poco F3 GT to Moto edge 50 fusion. Reason? Ahh motherboard dead out of nowhere ü•≤ü§å Service centre told it will take around Rs.18-20k to repair. So I went with Motorola üòå

2025-06-30T13:09:45Z
Edge 50 fusion is really good. I was using the 8 gb variant since previous year and recently upgraded to the 12 gb variant.

2025-06-30T19:02:04Z
Poco F series would have been better though

2025-06-30T19:41:22Z
aca uno que pego el volantazo de ir por un xiaomi/poco a un moto edge 50 fusion para la viejita. 

\-la optimizacion del sistema de motorola esta a a√±o luz de la de los chinos, el celu anda excelente.

\-el procesador se la banca muy bien en juegos pesados (para no ser ni de cerca lo mejor que tiene)

\-ram tiene de sobra

\-la capa de personalizacion que trae es bastante amplia y es excelente

\-cargador de 68 watts, en menos de 30 minutos ya lo tenes cargado y con los 5000 mAh te puede llegar a durar el dia cagandolo a palos.

la verdad que por lo que sale esta muy bueno.

Lo que si, obligatorio ponerle una Gcam porque flaquea en fotos con la camara principal, en video y lo demas, las fotos estan muy bien.

2025-06-30T23:43:45Z
bro 50 fusion soc is manufactured by samsung check on this [site](https://nanoreview.net/en/phone-compare/motorola-edge-60-fusion-vs-motorola-edge-50-fusion)

And motorola sells its official unit either on their own website or on flipkart 

And if u can buy their edge 60 ultra you would be happy upto 4 years 

and u can also checkout 50 NEO it is more powerful than 50 fusion and has flat display

But firstly I don't believe on amazon seller because motorola don't tie up with amazon

2025-06-29T21:52:52Z
THE CHIPSET MIGHT HEAT CAUSE MADE BY SAMSUNG

2025-06-23T04:07:07Z
Do you have attentive display turned on, the function uses your front facing camera 24/7 to know when you are looking at your screens so it won't automatically turn it off

2025-06-23T04:19:04Z
Press the camera pill up top in the right corner when it's active. What comes up then?

2025-06-23T04:45:49Z
What apps have you recently installed? Go to Settings > Security and Privacy > Privacy Dashboard > Camera and see what apps are accessing it. Are they third party apps or system apps? If they are third party just uninstall them, if they are system apps I'd try using Motorola's Software Fix app and reflashing if resetting didn't fix the issue.

2025-06-23T06:26:09Z
My advice: debloat your phone - my m 30 edge neo was laggy as hell, had a lot of crashes and drained the battery. So I debloated it with universal debloater and since then I have a fluid stable android phone. 
Lost some "Motorola" features and shortcuts but was worth it.

2025-06-23T08:51:46Z
It happens when you do a video call over phone call, using the video call feature available in the phones app, it's the same with my moto edge 30, just reboot and try to avoid doing video calls over google phones app, use WhatsApp instead

2025-06-23T10:56:04Z
No such thing on my Edge 30 Ultra. I honestly think that you need to consider debloating your phone as it might be some additional service of your choice running in the background and using it's permissions.

2025-06-23T23:18:22Z
What phone do you have l own a 24 edge the case on Amazon the camera has a sliding cover

2025-06-21T12:45:47Z
change ur home layout size to 5x7 or whatever is the max u can choose, gives more room for widgets

2025-06-15T23:14:39Z
In Mexico they advertised the Edge 40 as a flagship phone when it's not, the Edge 40 is getting Hello Ui Lite like other low end devices phone. On the Argentinian website they keep selling the Edge 50 Ultra as a phone "ranked" by dxomark. So don't take it personally, Motorola does that all the time.

2025-06-16T01:07:39Z
Surprise surprise. Guess what?  All the smartphone vendors, computer makers, router vendors, car makers, and pretty much everyone else make statements like this all the time in their marketing, and it's all legal.

2025-06-16T05:30:15Z
I have an edge 50 ultra here in Brazil with all things you said that not really exist in edge 50 line. Moto AI and circle to search are enabled.

2025-06-16T06:38:20Z
You should enable it in google settings. Long press home button to search and draw circle.

2025-06-21T09:46:59Z
On the Edge 40 there are many finishing problems, bugs that show that it has not been refined, it is as if it is still in beta ... for example when you press the volume button the volume window appears several seconds later If you want to start the music with the buttons on the headphones (JBL wired for me) it does not always work. Some games don't work very well, even though they're not that demanding... The DJI app for my drone is buggy, but on my Samsung it works perfectly.If I use nova launcher, the animations bug which is very ugly The Motorola weather widget does not always update, which means that for example at 11am, I had the night animation, sometimes it tells me that it is raining when there is a big sun It's full of little details that are quite annoying...

2025-07-02T09:46:09Z
They only give updates out of obligation. There is no profit to be made in providing updates, they would much prefer you buy a new phone.

2025-07-02T11:15:02Z
They moved the settings to change sim net from 4g to 5g inside so can't change it anymore by holding mobile data. Huge pain in the ass ngl.

regarding point 3, this version of the weather widget is available on A14 now too, older motorola phons like my G82 (A13) and even G50 (A12) also got it (just update app from google store), but in exchange for nice graphics we get ads in the application, zhich were not in the previous version

2025-07-02T19:52:57Z
Mods deleted my post, but this is what I've been trying to avoid, but I've been getting spammed with bursts of full screen pop-ups every 15-90 seconds that crash whatever app I have open, for upwards of half an hour at a time.


Really feels like they're trying to shove this stuff down our throat to make your phone worse so you have to buy another. I've recommended motorola for the last 10-12 years, but never again. This user experience is about as good as malware, with that same "we only need to get lucky once" implied threat.


One of these days I'm gonna accidentally hit "update now", and it'll be all over...

2025-07-03T10:24:27Z
Need to tap two times to activate and disable Bluetooth now...that sucks!

2025-07-02T12:40:57Z
Why do people continuously lose their minds about not receiving an android update (and security patches), and when they do receive an android update, they complain about very insignificant changes? 

I understand y'all's frustration.  But, android updates do not matter anymore.  There will never be a revolution in android updates.  This is the best it will be. 

If anyone expects an update to turn your phone into a supercomputer, to magically increase battery consumption, to somehow improve a processor and CPU into something that it's not and will never be?

Again, I understand being frustrated.  We have to accept that android updates will only offer very little improvements compared to its predecessor.  The fact is.. you're not receiving an update containing a UI that is similar to a more expensive phone 

Quit worrying about these things, people.  Your life will dramatically improve, I promise this.  I had to stop worrying about it and I did.  I just accept that it is what it is and that the revolution is over.

2025-07-02T11:02:44Z
why can't they provide blur for the notification shade

2025-07-04T07:22:46Z
I gave up on Motorola; the Moto Edge 40 is my last device from that brand. I think I'll buy an Oppo.

2025-07-04T10:10:33Z
I'm pretty sure the scrolling lag is because of the dynamic refresh rate. The device can't decide quickly enough when to switch to 60hz or higher. YouTube shorts is the biggest example of this lag.

2025-07-02T10:31:20Z
How do you get that lockscreen time font??
I couldn't find on my edge 40 even after A15

2025-07-02T14:09:20Z
Since the patch I can no longer install apps from APKPURE. I get the error message "..app isn't compatible with your device.".

These are these apps that are not available to me on Google Play unless I change my Google Profile - which I don't want since costs of services are cheaper in the country of my current profile.

2025-07-02T15:25:32Z
Fingerprint not working after update

2025-07-02T15:50:31Z
how do i find the clock widget and the widget below it in picture 4?

Also what i found new.  
Go to personalize -> wallpaper -> curated images. You find some different color combinations which i found interesting.

2025-07-02T17:06:40Z
Do a reset to phone it will automatically show u android 14 ui with 15 features in it.
Tried and tested on edge 30 ultra

2025-07-02T19:27:03Z
I switched from a Motorola to a Pixel 9 last December. I'm really enjoying Android 16 and we're getting a UI update in September.

2025-07-02T23:54:10Z
Yes you forgot...Android is a Google issue!  
Your points are valid but it seems they have more to do with Hello UX from Motorola.  
On my device (Moto G75) the changes were almost imperceptible (A14 to A15).  
As a matter of fact the only things I noticed were the Bluetooth menu and circle to search.

2025-07-03T01:20:49Z

What font you have used for the lock screen

2025-07-03T10:08:01Z
How you get the new control centre layout?
I also updated my edge 40 to a15 but i didn't get it

2025-07-03T10:25:44Z
Don't expect any new features in old phones. That's how business works.

2025-07-03T10:55:51Z
Android 15? Damn Motorola is really slacking on software development

2025-07-03T15:50:58Z

2025-07-03T16:07:57Z
Circle to search works, you just have to long press the home slider at the bottom of the screen anywhere.

Where did you get those icons from?? They look really nice

2025-07-04T07:53:59Z
Hello. Do a clean install in Software Fix App and then do a review. :)

2025-07-04T10:04:26Z
I wonder how you measured, that the battery is draining faster, than before, if it is a "day 1" review...
And why would you need a volume button double click for camera - moto gestures with shaking and chopping are so good... 
For me actually, the less new functions - the better. I came from xiaomi, where everything has a toggle for something... 
Motorola is known to have "clean", minimal software, maybe you should have bought xiaomi or samsung...

2025-07-07T02:08:06Z
What about for Edge 50 fusion?

2025-07-07T11:24:11Z
" Fingerprint hardware is not available " after the update !

2025-07-09T01:06:18Z
This is not good at all, my moto edge 40 was a bullet on Android 14, now its performance has worsened, what did they do? It is unacceptable just a few months ago I bought it and they ruined my cell phone like this, fix this!!

2025-07-02T11:44:05Z
Heureusement, j'ai enfin un Samsung... Maintenant qu'est-ce que je vais faire de cette poubelle...?? Je me le demande... La mise √† jour n'a plus aucun sens au vu de ce que tu rapportes, autant rester sur Android 14. Je suis en Europe et clairement ici, ce type de mise √† jour est inacceptable et attaquable en justice car c'est un d√©faut de conformit√©. Mais pourquoi vais-je perdre mon temps avec cette Marque qui n'est m√™me pas capable d'avoir un v√©ritable Service client.. Il me font penser √† certains vendeurs que j'ai connus sur ebay, ils vous promettent monts et merveilles, mais vous arnaquent brutalement avec le sourire. Je ne comprends pas comment certains d'entre vous s'obstinent avec cette marque qui est morte depuis longtemps et m√©rite de disparaitre.. √† moins qu'elle soit rachet√©e √† nouveau, mais cette fois par des comp√©tent.

Check official Motorola site here, the price is updated regularly. There may be some small difference and the price quoted at the official store is final.

                  Was Protective "semi-rubber" case on it?

2025-06-14T08:49:40Z
You can try online through motorola website to see official stores near you or call them up and ask. Like this i repaired my phone here

2025-06-11T10:33:47Z
My edge 30 got a green line after software update. The service center asked for 9k to replace and no warranty. Instead they blamed the green line as water damage and made up a story around that. What clowns! Don't buy motorola, not what they used to be

2025-06-11T07:01:39Z
bina cover ke use karte ho kya ?

2025-06-11T07:25:00Z
Hello,
I had a broken display on my Edge 50 Fusion, so I contacted a local phone repair service. 
After waiting one week for the replacement display to arrive, the dude replaced both the screen and the back battery cover (in a new color, which I ordered from AliExpress).

The whole process took just 2 hours. Honestly, it feels like I got a brand-new phone!

I paid ~100eur everything.

2025-06-11T10:11:03Z
Hope motherboard isn't Damage.

2025-06-11T12:06:59Z
Bhai mazak nahi ker raha saste mai gir raha hai tumhe meri display bhi tuth gaya tha 7k liya un log ne and got repaired after almost a month because they didn't had display

2025-06-11T13:05:20Z
I had repaired it for 7.5k for edge 40 neo which has a similar display. At 5k you're getting it damn cheap.

2025-06-11T13:53:22Z
I repaired my 50 fusion for 7k for the display along with front panel. I had only one official service center in my city.

2025-06-11T14:58:22Z
my phone was just 1.5 months old when it felt from the bed and got a tiny crack on the sideways. had to pay 7.5k coz it wouldn't work and ig the fall did some damage to the motherboard. you're getting it cheaper for 5k

2025-06-11T18:13:47Z
It will take 7-8k to replace the whole front panel and please do it from official store

2025-06-12T00:51:19Z
Wow I stopped using screen protectors because with Gorilla Glass it's almost impossible to break these phones I've been going without a case for years and I dropped my phone from Heights and construction sites from trucks it literally bangs around all day I guess Gorilla Glass ain't all that

2025-06-12T19:17:24Z
How do yall do this much damage ive got a small crack on my screen and immediately put on a screen protector

2025-06-09T09:58:56Z
How on earth would a screen protector help in this case? Bad luck. It fell on the corner. For sure a decent case would have helped. Sorry for the loss, get it replaced.

2025-06-09T10:07:33Z
That's not covered by warranty, unless you have insurance, you are paying for that.

Also a screen protector protects against scratches, not fuckin drops and hits lol....

2025-06-09T11:22:21Z
MIL-STD 810H Military standard and Gorilla¬Æ Glassüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è

2025-06-09T11:23:22Z
Btw I think the case is not good

2025-06-09T11:34:45Z
That case ain't gonna protect your phone. It's just for looks. It needs to be completely covered all around the corner. 


I have also dropped my phone many times, it's because of the edge lip on the case which prevented from damaging the screen.

2025-06-09T15:54:18Z
You should've invested in a better case.

2025-06-09T15:39:28Z
its the fault of the case. that case gives absolutely no protection imo

2025-06-09T10:07:04Z
I have Edge 40, identical Crack.

2025-06-09T11:32:07Z
Mil Spec, IP rating etc are just standards that a phone can pass or fail. It doesn't give magical properties to a phone. Glass is glass and glass can break.

Your screen protector is made of weaker materials than the glass on your screen. It may help avoid minor scratches, but for huge hits, it's completely useless.

From the three spots that it is damaged, it looks like your phone rolled on the edges, and the broken plastic suggests it was a major damage. The phone can take your occasional accidental drops, but not this kind of hit. Corners are where the phone is most venerable and has the least protection.

Warranty does not cover physical damage.

Your only options are using as is if the screen works, getting the screen replaced or getting the glass replaced if possible at a 3rd party store.

2025-06-09T12:56:39Z
I've got similar cracks on all 4 corners of my edge 40 neo, I just live with them, one corner has started to bleed and cause a splotch but I don't really pay any notice to it!

2025-06-09T16:15:40Z
Well, you had that incompetent back case which wasn't covering the sides.. So now you face the consequences..

2025-06-09T17:43:26Z
Screen protectors don't protect from falls, they're only supposed to protect from minor scratches, if the screen cracks with a screen protector on it does not mean it failed, it means that whatever hit it took was going to break it,  screen protector or not.

2025-06-09T22:08:54Z
Did display survive?

2025-06-10T18:34:53Z
ahh, my edge 40 neo cracked because it fell on rocks, and played geometry dash

2025-06-10T19:47:58Z
You really should've invested in a better case, the stock one is trash

2025-06-09T10:02:12Z
So what purpose does military grade certification serve? Is it merely a marketing ploy with no real credibility?

2025-06-09T10:44:58Z
Don't buy curved display shit

2025-06-23T21:18:01Z
Not even the Edge 40 received blur? For the love of god, what is Motorola's logic?

2025-06-23T21:27:55Z
I'm organizing a massive protest against Motorola. Enough of them mocking us when all we do is give them our money.

2025-06-23T22:22:37Z
Lock screen customization is available. Only 3 new clock faces with 3 newer fonts style in it.
You can access them by heading to Settings > Personalize > Lock Screen > Click on the clock face twice. Then the customization option will appear.
Thanks me later.

2025-06-23T22:44:20Z

Turn off ram boost it does more bad than good and just takes up ur storage

2025-06-24T02:28:17Z
Nah, that's fake news. Where can I report it? ü´†

2025-06-24T15:41:41Z
I have not received the update

2025-06-23T21:14:09Z
I feel sorry broü´§   
What do you mean the lock screen is not customizable either? It works with Android 15 on G54

2025-06-24T19:03:32Z
Unrelated 

Man disable the ram boost 
It's just a ruse
Might make your storage weaker... It gets complaint fast, higher risk since the phone has ufs 2.2

2025-06-24T08:33:07Z
The blur is available with other launchers so it's really a nonsense, damn but I can't wait to change my mobile! And I hope they get what they deserve! Motorola is dead since the takeovers, that's how it is

2025-06-24T02:38:38Z
You recieved the stable version bro ?

2025-06-24T23:22:57Z
There's a blur? My edge 5G doesn't have any blur but was on 15 beta and 15 now

2025-07-01T17:38:00Z
The edge 50 neo has anywhere between 700-1200mah less battery compared to the other phones in the video and 700mah less than the CMF phone 2 pro.

The only reason the edge 50 neo is coming close in such tests is due to the LTPO display and the mid range dimensity 7300 not using too much power.

When it comes to cameras, physically the edge 50 neo has all round better cameras + OIS compared to the CMF phone 2 pro. While Motorola's camera software has improved, the post processing on the photo mode causes lag, given the performance of the device, but the photos are generally good.

Here are some random camera samples I took 
https://imgur.com/gallery/edge-50-neo-photo-random-bag-JihCCzG 

Even being 1 year old, the edge 50 neo has 4 yrs of android updates compared to the CMF phone 2 pro's 3 years, but the CMF phone 2 pro has 1 more year of security update in total. 

On the edge 50 neo, you are getting a relatively compact phone, good daily driver, bright screen outdoors, long software support and decent to good camera setup. 

Compared to others in its price range, you are sacrificing battery capacity and on paper performance. Motorola bloat depends on region. In my region (India), the edge 50 neo comes with 3 pre-installed apps and not much else in terms of bloat.

2025-07-01T18:05:06Z

I have seen couple of reviews that skin tone is very bad, One of my friend has edge 40, it has nice camera skin tone is also good. Please share your views. I am looking for a mobile 20-25k, please share thoughts about the new 60 series too.

2025-07-03T09:05:53Z
CAMERA:- 
Being a moto edge 50 neo user, i can guarantee its amazing camera quality but somewhere it struggles in video recording and even its camera lags while switching from 1√ó to 2√ó or 3√ó. The photos are enhanced and well detailed and it provides ready to post results. I am also a photography kinda person that's why I chose this model aware of its small battery. 

BATTERY:- 
Battery life is really short. It can hardly go 6-6:30 hours under moderate usage and 4hrs under heavy usage. I am a college student and I don't use my phone between 9-4:30 that much but every day I noticed a battery decay of 30-40% out of nowhere. I have to keep it's brightness low and dark mode for a decent battery backup.
If you are a heavy user, then YES, IT'S BATTERY WILL DEFINITELY TROUBLE YOU..!!

It's my personal opinion don't sacrifice battery Life for a good camera you'll regret. Find some different options.

I have attached some camera samples
[Moto edge 50 neo Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wu0Xyt30-F_c50qw8mZxanKZOOoDaYDk)

2025-07-03T12:56:25Z
I will be frank here, the edge 50 neo is not worthy even when i 2024 . The mobiles is super laggy and battery drain is crazy like maximum sot is 3.35hrs on heavy use. Heating too easily in outdoor conditions like it's reaches 50¬∞ just from turning on the 5g data. Camera app is horrible. But you won't  notice this if you are coming from too old devices like redmi 5a and more, but if you coming from master piece like note 7s and oneplus 7t your experience will be horrendous.

2025-07-01T19:10:37Z
It still has the best camera setup in this price range tbh if you want an all rounder camera then go for it otherwise don't... Battery okiesh I get around 5-6 sot on moderate use till 20% but sometimes it drains battery a lot maybe cuz of heat

2025-07-01T23:56:57Z

Hey i am a moderate user and i need to charge once a day with 9 am to 3 am at night and i have 10 percent juice left i use reddit youtube netflix etx sot 5-6 hrs

2025-07-03T06:10:03Z
another edge 50 owner here:

I noticed that when I am at home on WiFi then the battery doesn't drop below 40-ish % by the end of the day, despite the "heavy" usage (lots of reels, YouTube, messengers, web browsing).
But when I am running errands around the city and on LTE and use the phone only for calls, occasional messengers and googling stuff, the battery drops below 20% and activates the saving mode by 5 pm making me to worry if it's gonna last till I get home

2025-07-05T10:47:44Z
50 neo is great if u want a bigger battery go for 60 fusion, 2 days easy woth a full charge

2025-07-01T17:06:53Z
I get 3 days of light usage. 
It's not very smooth. Stuttering in apps like twitter and reddit when scrolling

2025-07-01T18:58:15Z
It lags , the battery is sh*t , bugs that never get patched

2025-07-05T07:06:56Z
There will be an Edge 60 neo ??

2025-07-05T07:32:00Z
Better wait for 60 neo if you can... I'm saying cuz of the battery 60 neo will have a new bigger silicon carbon battery and if they don't downgrade any hardware it would be the best all rounder smartphone it's budget

2025-07-05T13:09:05Z
Wait for edge 60 neo. I'm going to purchase as well.

2025-07-05T23:45:19Z
The new you get...

The better you see...

That one is android...

Leave the old and catch on to the new stuff buddy...

2025-07-05T07:28:05Z
U shouldn't buy Motorola

2025-07-07T03:36:17Z
Both have nearly similar performances.¬†


But 2 things seperate them. 50 ultra has 64mp telephoto lens vs 60 pro has 8mp. Ultra can record better video vs pro. But pro 60 haa better battery life with 6000mah and ultra has 4500. So you choose what's more important to you while the price difference is nearly 17k.


I chose edge 60 Pro and I use my phone extensively to play games, browse 100 webistes, msg, youtube, etc and only charge once in 2 days. I'm ok to not have a better camera as I don't use it much.

2025-07-06T21:43:54Z
I would go with the edge 50 ultra that's a true flagship The edge 60 pro now that's kind of a joke. It's all plastic USB 2.0

2025-07-07T11:19:10Z
I have the edge 60 pro and it is excellent in all areas. I recommend it to you.

2025-07-07T11:51:55Z
Go for the new one without a blink of an eye...

The old device is old and is not good especially when it comes for Android devices...

50 Ultra is an ex-flagship phone

60 Pro is a mid-range

2025-07-08T01:27:53Z
60 pro battery is underwhelming. Cameras not as good in any area imo. Not bad, just not as good. A tad wider feel in the hand. Corners a bit sharper. Charging definitely slower. I returned 60 pro because I liked my current 50 pro better. Looking to upgrade to 50 ultra.

2025-07-07T00:28:57Z
The Edge 50 ultra is a flagship and the Edge 60 Pro is a (good) mid-ranger. The 50 ultra is much better.

I am scared now, since I have the same model. My unit also overheats sometimes during charging, but I used to think it's normal as it charges rapidly with its 125W charging brick.

2025-06-08T15:06:31Z
hey guys i really need your help,please tweet about this,need all the help i can get.its still in warranty , but i am sure i will need help

2025-06-10T00:43:18Z
Bro, what did you actually do with your cell phone to make it get to this state of heating up on its own and burning to the point of almost exploding? Where did you buy it? Before that, was everything normal with him? Because this case of yours is isolated and very strange, I've had mine for 7 months and nothing has ever happened, the only time it got very hot was on the first day I bought it and started configuring it, then it started installing and updating apps and the system, but it's normal for it to heat up because it was the first day of use, but after installing everything it went back to normal and stopped heating up, now this case of yours really is very strange.

2025-06-28T07:18:42Z
there were reports before of moto phones melting while charging, my guess the fast charger was at fault. I never used that with my edge 2023+, just kept my old pixel charger, the battery is still good after two years.

2025-06-13T13:06:36Z
When will edge 50pro will get AI update?

2025-06-13T10:55:31Z
What security patch is it?

2025-06-13T17:01:52Z
When for low budget mobiles like g series mine g45 5g

2025-07-02T11:26:10Z
Hi!

Does it comes with the new features like Image Studio, Next Move or the playlist thing? Thank you

2025-06-13T19:09:51Z
Why is it 2.20 GB if it's just a security patch? It makes no sense. It's also V2.

2025-06-13T14:34:12Z
Wait for the edge 60 neo. If it has the same 5 years update, the most longevity. If you can't wait, then the edge 50 neo still has 4 years left.

2025-06-13T15:43:39Z
From your list, I'd say either the G75 or 50 Neo would be your best option. They're pretty good devices and have read mostly positive comments about them. Personally I'd go for the Neo.

2025-06-13T16:47:45Z
Edge 50 neo. Incredible phone

2025-06-13T17:10:34Z
i have the neo, really solid phone

2025-06-13T16:58:01Z
Wow, the back of the Moto One is very nice.
So, you know that the G54 has a Power version, right? I only recommend the power version.     
I have the G54 power, and Edge 50 neo.   
The G54 Power takes grayish photos, compared to the Edge 50 Neo.     
The Edge 50 Neo has a weaker battery, than the G54 Power.     
The fingerprint reader works well on both, only the Edge 50 Neo has the fingerprint reader under the screen, and since it‚Äôs 2D, the area where it scans your finger lights up very brightly in the dark. you have to fully place your finger on it so it doesn't blind you at night

2025-06-14T13:10:52Z
I have a point here. Don't mix Edge 50 Neo with other phones because it comes under the compact phone category and has different parameters for assessment.

2025-06-13T12:52:03Z
So the protector is flat but the screen is curved?

2025-06-13T12:52:26Z
Since I'm from Germany I used that one: [link](https://www.schutzfolien24.de/artikel/2x-brotect-flex-full-screen-folie-fuer-motorola-edge-50-neo-5157143.html?froogle=1&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21489339033&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmK_CBhCEARIsAMKwcD7SiOs5FXAaOJbhXMSLzbw8iIzs3Kq-1tgI_Hfq4RjbbMU536emXyYaAj2pEALw_wcB)

Works really good for me, had another one first, didn't register touches on the sides of the display

2025-06-13T12:00:47Z
Mine wasn't that bad. I got another matte one and it came with a tiny brush and some liquid. I put the liquid along the edge of the screen protector and it looked much, much better.

2025-06-13T12:03:40Z
P.S. The screen was completely cleaned with alcohol and dried with tools/materials included.

2025-06-13T12:23:40Z
What does the protector box look like? on mine writes "5D glass" or something like that, and there was an iPhone 7 picture in the box.   
I have the same problem with the screen protector, 50 Neo.     
I haven't tried any other protector yet.   
Maybe the protector is crap, or the edges of the 50 Neo are like this

2025-06-13T13:15:47Z
Is it flexible or hard type. I used matte hydrogel type. It was like this for the first time and slowly it took shape on edges as  it dried.

2025-06-13T23:54:07Z
Haven't use any ever since I purchased it.

2025-06-17T06:19:03Z
Okay, after I told the seller on Amazon, they refunded me. I just asked what I did wrong, not asked for a refund, but it's a good outcome.

I'll buy another one lol. Thanks everyone.

2025-07-07T11:28:03Z
On seeing to the video you've posted here, I think the pins in the USB type C socket are shorting...

The reasons may differ based upon usage sans the way that device is connected and disconnected...

When the pins in the socket gets short due to accumulation of dust particles then there are chances that a false signal is sent to the system to think that it is connected.

This shorting in the pins in there also results in battery draining and many more issues...

You need to immediately get it replaced with a original one otherwise your device will be gone forever...

2025-07-07T13:25:26Z
Damn, I'm getting scared by the number of defects in these Motorola devices.

2025-07-07T10:32:26Z
Replace it if you can, there might be something wrong with the wiring of the battery

2025-07-07T13:32:12Z
I am facing the same issue. I went to the service center and told me they will have to open the phone and check the charging port but it is not that big an issue. If the phone is charging fine, i can continue using it.

2025-07-07T17:08:12Z
Whatever the problem is with the Motorola Edge 50 Pro 
Don't Panic bro

All problems have one solution 

RESTART

2025-07-08T05:17:11Z
My phone gives a similar message but it says "OPs mom detected in the charging port, please remove within 5-10 business days"

2025-06-15T15:37:08Z
Don't ever think of buying the Edge 50 Neo unless you are a fan of compact size phones. See, the biggest USP of this phone is its size of 6.4". At a larger size base, 6.7" or more, there are plenty of options and many of them are better than this one. But if you want a compact phone and have a budget constraint, don't go anywhere other than Moto Edge 50 Neo. At this size and price range there is simply no competition.

And please don't compare this with the Edge 60 Pro. They are for different people.

2025-06-15T16:07:27Z
I had the same dilemma a few days ago, and I decided to go with Edge 60 pro instead of 50 neo, and believe me when I say it's definitely the right choice, with no regrets at all.
But if I had bought 50 neo, I would just say that the android updates and small screen are pros, but everything else especially battery is a con compared to 60 pro.

2025-06-15T15:09:56Z
Hi, ye i have had an edge 50 neo for about 4 months now, i do like it, overall no complaints, but i have seen some bloatware popping up recently, but not too much.

Overall i would say that it is up to your preference: do you like a curved screen? ( If no go for 50neo). Do you want better battery life? ( If yes go for the 60 pro). If you want a more compact phone go for the 50 neo.

2025-06-15T15:27:51Z
Better SOC> longer android updates.


Software updates are becoming minor releases. No major changeovers. 

Again, on SOC, it will help you capture better and faster shots. 

The colors of 60 pro are phenomenal :)

2025-06-15T17:50:42Z
I had the 50 neo where the battery life was very bad for me. I don't know if everyone has encountered this concern for autonomy, but I quickly separated myself from it. Now I have the 60 pro and I am completely satisfied with it. The battery life is crazy and I love the curved screens so much. I highly recommend the 60 pro.

2025-06-16T20:09:31Z
What are you going to use the phone for? If you just want it for browsing and chatting, performance doesn't play any role.

I went from Pixel 4a to 50 Neo and couldn't be happier. Size is very similar, better lenses, better battery, etc. can't imagine going with anything bigger.. and I hate curved screens and similar gimmicks.

Battery lasts me the full day.

2025-06-15T15:08:01Z
the 50 neo also has a 1700mah smaller battery thats almost 1/4-1/3 less then the 60 pro

2025-06-15T17:11:50Z
I've used both in the past two months lol

Bought them both for 330-340 euro.

Pro is better in every way

I like compact phones so I was worried about not liking the Pro's size but I actually love it more. Sure it may have a larger screen but the weight is the same and thanks to the curved design the Pro feels even better in the hand

2025-07-05T18:05:20Z
This is Motorola sub so people will suggest you to buy Motorola. Even I have Edge 50 Neo but I don't like to keep biases and I don't like being a fan boy of any company. No there is no such reported issue with Edge 50 Neo. But that being said, you would be foolish to write off Nothing after their first blunder. My suggestion is to go for Nothing Phone 3a because its an overall better phone. Better software quality, faster updates, etc. Only reason I bought Edge 50 Neo is because I wanted a smaller phone. And its not even that small. Nothing Phone 3a is the better decision. 50 neo has a few annoying issues that you won't find in reviews like wifi and Bluetooth not being so good, battery life average, I'm also recently started facing issues with the usb port. Overall its a good phone for the price I got it for but Nothing Phone 3a is the overall better device except for some specific features like ip68 and wireless charging.

2025-07-05T19:51:38Z
If you don't much care about cameras get the 3a 

Better processor optimization and updates

You'll have a more polished and premium experience with nothing 3a

2025-07-05T17:51:52Z
"green lines on the display and dead motherboards"

You will never have such a problem. if so, it's a faulty model. Buy it from a place where you have time to return it.    
And if you like Nothing 3A, buy it. why do you care what a regular 3 is like.

2025-07-05T19:25:25Z
go for the neo, i have one, fully recommend.

2025-07-05T17:35:34Z
Bought the moto edge 50 neo for my mom couple of months ago and we haven‚Äôt had any issues at all with it. Fantastic phone for the price.

2025-07-06T04:38:02Z
Some users (me)  are having battery issue... SOME overall the phone is good in its price range

2025-07-06T09:32:26Z
Look at the edge pro too, Often 40% off.

2025-07-07T03:51:30Z
Unless u really want a "compact" phone go for it the camera is decent for the price battery is something that holds the phone back if ur not a serious power user the edge 50 neo is a good deal otherwise id say to get the nothing phone 3a

2025-06-08T10:55:20Z
what's the max zoom ??

2025-06-08T10:29:53Z
Isn't the video recording poor for a flagship device ?

2025-06-08T10:38:29Z
But sadly the video recording is very poor.

2025-07-04T11:20:13Z
Lol, I actually don't see any change at all visually. I am only happy passkey now works, because I needed it for work. I noticed that charging is getting disrupted for some reason, so I hope that doesn't ruin this phone for me. Anyway, I'm not getting another motorola after this.

2025-07-04T11:48:29Z
Phones can often do with a factory reset after a major update like that which can prevent excess battery drain or other random bugs. 

As far as the major updates themselves go‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like every other OS out there whether it be Android, IOS, Windows, etc these days. There‚Äôs nothing drastically different about them version to version anymore and is usually just a handful of tweaks and feature changes. Essentially more just a feature/service pack to the existing OS rather than a whole new ground up one. 15 really didn‚Äôt bring much to any phone. As far as the hello UI and all goes, that is motos software and nothing really to do with Android version.

2025-07-04T11:43:39Z
Since the patch I've been unable to install some geolocked apps from APKPURE.

2025-07-04T12:05:12Z
I have a moto edge 50 neo, if I get A16 the changes will be like this? Incremental updates?

2025-07-04T11:45:09Z
I will never buy any Motorola or Lenovo device again.

That happens because you charge it too much, you should wait a little longer.

The same thing happened to me yesterday on my e50p. Worked fine 30b mins later. Don't worry. Motorola sucks. Don't buy again.

2025-06-24T11:05:10Z
attach a ss of battery usage

2025-07-07T07:24:27Z
Moved circa 2 years ago from iPhone 11 Pro to Edge 40, previously I have been an Apple user for more than 10 years.  
I simply fall in love with Edge 40, smooth every day, 2 days of battery without any restriction, in my case I also love curved display.  
Also I can finally manage files inside my phones in a serious way, on iOS I had problem of storage utilization for years, and only solution given from support was to reset the device every time.  
I really like the auto enhance feature for the camera, a lot of people complain about the camera, but I really like it  
In my opinion be sure to move calendar and contacts to google (if you don't already have there) before start the migration process, whatsapp as usual could be tricky to move

bye!!

2025-07-07T10:44:49Z
I went from iPhone 15 to moto edge 25. I'm not really into Apple ecosystem outside of iPhone, I've used both platforms for years, but was ready for a change again. I even compared daily tasks to wife's iPhone 16 pro. Yes gaming maybe worse, which I didn't game on phone, but daily tasks, etc phone feels great, aspect ratio feels good, didn't hurt hand. I love it.

2025-07-07T12:41:36Z
The Edge 50 Ultra is the best phone that Motorola has made. It has ultra wide band and video out on USB-C. It all depends on your use case but it has all the bells and whistles so that's Motorola's flagship phone

2025-07-07T16:31:07Z
Every device has its own good and bad...

It is for you to decide wisely for you'll be buying it to use for yourself.

2025-07-07T18:57:58Z
I went from an iPhone 12 to an Edge 2022, and currently an Edge 2024. While I've had Android work phones along the way, I've had iPhones since the original one for my personal phones. I really don't miss iPhone, at all. The 12 has a much stronger processor than my current edge 2024, I'm pretty sure any relatively current iPhone has better cameras than any moto, and there are a couple purely preference things I like better with IOS like car play > Android Auto...but otherwise I gain a lot more tangible benefits like better battery life, high refresh screen, etc at a much lower price on Android. I'm not a big phone gamer or do anything else crazy intensive on my phones, so the difference in processing has not been an issue. My Edges have been adequate and does all the usual everyday stuff just as well. I thought there would be some adjustment period/growing pains simply due to the switching gears like that, but there really wasn't. And again, this is with the regular North American Edges which are lessor phones than the ultra.

Really I think smartphones have evolved enough that anything half decent will work pretty well and anything beyond you can simply buy based on need vs buying as much as you can afford to have a decent experience with even everyday common use. Kinda like where computers were at years ago.

2025-07-08T06:36:49Z
Just stay on iphone. U gonna regret it. Moto user here

2025-07-07T07:20:11Z
Honestly no, don't do that switching from a flagship lvl phone to 'Moto' isn't really the best choice. The updates are awful and there are bugs that could actually ruin your entire experience of using the phone. Go for some other device. Save yourself and don't use Motorola.

2025-07-08T11:10:02Z
I have used these kinds of cases although I found them for cheaper. But they lose the colour from edges with more ware.

2025-07-08T11:52:38Z
Glass is out of stock?

2025-07-08T13:49:15Z
Looks nice, but if I was in your position, i would buy a phone case that matches the color of the ph9ne or a transparent one

I was facing the same on my edge 50 neo but after that i started watching movies and shows after downloading but eventually it solved it self and currently at this time i am watch family man season 2 (not downloaded i am streaming at Best quality) do you updated the prime video app?

2025-06-18T18:12:29Z
Hi u/rkagasti95, I'm sorry to hear about the frustrating streaming experience on your Motorola Edge 50. The issue of Prime Video defaulting to 480p, despite having a solid internet connection and other devices streaming in higher resolutions. Let me help you. Could you tell me how it started? Did it start after a software update? Have you tried to check if there are updates both with your phone and the Prime app? If yes, please install the updates. This will help fix any bugs. Let me know how it goes. -Carlos

2025-06-19T04:19:48Z
Can I suggest a workaround? Try to reinstall the app and try.

2025-06-28T15:07:35Z
Seems pretty pointless to risk bricking your phone, and removing a bunch of built in features, just to run an Android 16 test image.

Android 16 has barely any changes over 15. You aren't missing out on anything.

2025-07-01T05:54:16Z
I'm updating from here with Motoflash pro, official builds from manufactures. Safe to do it just to update before the carriers release them to public, no bootloader unlocked needed.

Moto Edge 50 Fusion After New 97.71MB Update If I Choose Colour Type Natural Or Radiant It Is Not showing Pure Black (Test In Dark Room)

If I Choose a Vivid Colour Then You See Pure Black (Test In Dark Room)

1- Set the brightness to full 
2- Search for a black screen video on YouTube and the video will play in full screen
3- Set the color to natural
Now you will have to check in a dark room.

The issue is Clearly visible only when the whole screen is black.

1. Set screen refresh rate to 60hz
2. Take away permissions which are not required 
3. Stop background activity of apps that don't need it
4. Stop Background data consumption for apps that don't need it
5. Set adaptive battery on 


Camera is slow ? How? 


Device overheating when charging it's normal it does get very hot (125w is too much)

Where do you find the VolTE settings on your phone? I can't seem to find them.

2025-07-05T08:00:36Z
Using 2G is this huge security risk it opens the door to 2fa vulnerabilities  really weak encryption, it also Lacks authentication between your device and the cell tower. That's why it's usually only used for emergency services that's why most modern devices allow you to turn 2G off and there's usually a warning next to it that tells you that 2G is not safe

2025-06-26T08:06:48Z
Worse than Motorola Edge 30 Fusion üî•üî•üî•

2025-06-09T07:07:44Z
Every thing is good about this phone except the camera processing lag

2025-06-28T09:28:54Z
I have ram thingy turned off. It's probably too aggressive so it swaps too early.

2025-06-28T14:05:30Z
Turn off animations. The visual trade off is worth it.

2025-06-29T03:57:41Z
If you got taboola live lock screen installed uninstall it immediately with android debugger((guide in this forum somewhere). Advertisement spyware and drains battery

Disable all moto and meta apps except moto security if you don't need moto features. Constant notifications and useless game and app promotions and drains battery

If you have poor 5g signal force the phone to use 4 g it saves some battery.

Do not use a fast charger all the time, it generally reduces battery health over time. Lock the charge to 80% to preserve battery health.

I got the same version i typically go from 80 to 40% battery after a workday with these settings.
Approximately 2 hours of spotify, 2 hours browsing and so me activity. Use mostly in public transport.

2025-07-04T07:43:44Z
havent gotten that issue at all, i have the 60 pro, its a very nice one and battery life has been awsome, i dont use anything heavy or heavy gaming(only halls of torment). With my previous phone i had sometimes problems with calling but only when using wifi calling so i always disable that

2025-06-27T15:00:49Z
Have you tried cleaning the port?

2025-06-27T14:52:29Z
Same issue going on with my moto g85

2025-06-27T15:16:36Z
Same for me on moto edge 40..

2025-06-18T09:31:01Z
Charging is not linear, there are a lot of factors affecting the speed including how hot it is where you live, how hot your phone is, are you using the phone etc etc.

It's possible that the 45 min mark is with charge boost on.

2025-06-18T16:51:45Z
Hi u/Barani_SpotsPlanez, Thanks for sharing your experience with charging the Edge 50 Neo. The official 68W TurboPower charger Motorola includes can charge the phone from 0 to about 50-60% very fast, often around 30 minutes for that initial jump. After around **50-60% battery**, the charging speed slows down to protect battery health and avoid overheating. This tapering can make the last 30-40% take longer. So, hitting **65% in 1 hour** starting from 1% is actually within a normal range, especially if the charger slowed down to preserve battery longevity. Here's what you can do:

1. **Try charging while the phone is off or in airplane mode** to see if it charges faster.
2. **Test another original Motorola 68W charger and cable** if possible.
3. **Keep the phone and charger in a cool environment** during charging.

Let me know if this helps. -Carlos

Hi u/No-Type3891, thank you for posting. The Moto AI features will only be rolling out to the Motorola Razr 50 family and Edge 50 Ultra.  The Moto AI Service on Motorola devices (especially newer ones like the Moto Edge 50 series) is a system-level background service that supports Motorola‚Äôs AI-powered features across the UI and apps. Like features include Digital Wellbeing enhancement and Camera AI enhancement. -Carlos

2025-07-07T11:57:46Z

Bro instead of making a post about this issue which was covered many times here, just google : How to disable Motorola apps installing on their own and boom, you will find many Reddit posts addressing this issue and boom, there is the solution.

2025-06-27T13:10:13Z
I'm using the same device and did not have any such apps you mentioned maybe it has something to with pre installed moto apps

2025-06-24T21:17:35Z
Hi u/r4wm3, Thank you for your detailed explanation, and I completely understand how frustrating this problem is, especially since your phone appears to have **functional mobile data**, but **calls (even basic 2G calls) fail consistently unless rebooted**. Let's try to narrow it down:

1. **Which mobile carrier are you using**, and are VoLTE or VoWiFi services officially supported by them on Motorola devices?
2. **Do you notice call failures in specific locations only** (e.g., home, work), or does it happen everywhere?
3. **Are you typically using 4G, 5G, or falling back to 2G/3G** when trying to make calls?
4. **Can others call you during this time**, or does their call also fail (as if your phone is unreachable)?
5. **Are SMS (texts) affected at the same time** the calling fails?
6. Have you ever tried using a **different SIM from another carrier**, and does it behave the same way?

Here are some troubleshooting steps you could try:

1. Force LTE Only (VoLTE Preferred) or 2G/3G

* Go to: **Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile network > Preferred network type**
* Try:
   * **LTE only** (VoLTE active)
   * Or **3G/2G only**, just to test call functionality
* If one of these options improves things, it points toward **handover or fallback issues** in mixed network zones.

2. Check IMS Registration

Dial `*#*#4636#*#*` \> Phone Information > Scroll down:

* **Is IMS Registered?** If not, VoLTE/VoWiFi may silently fail.
* Try toggling **‚ÄúVoLTE Provisioned‚Äù** and restarting.

3. Reset Network Settings

* **Settings > System > Reset options > Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth**
* This clears hidden misconfigurations in SIM profiles and IMS settings.

4. **Try a Different SIM or Carrier**

* Just for testing: try a different SIM (preferably from another carrier), and see if the issue persists.
* If a second SIM shows better reliability, your original carrier profile (APN, IMS settings) may be incompatible with Motorola‚Äôs IMS implementation.

Let me know if this helps. -Carlos

2025-07-01T23:51:41Z
I have the LATAM version and got A15 like a week ago. So, in my case, I'm not expecting A16 anytime soon.

2025-07-07T13:35:31Z
The edge 50 pro and edge 50 fusion are already being tested for those who registered in the motorola community, and will be available to everyone by the end of the year

2025-06-30T16:36:18Z
Maybe cite your sources of information? It's definitely not a well known problem.

I've had the Fusion, Neo and Pro from the Edge 50 series, and had no issues with recorded volume.

The only phone where I found the volume to be a little quiet on a recorded video was the standard Edge 60.

2025-06-30T19:52:08Z
The edge 50 series is a good choice depending on the model definitely stick with the pro or the ultra

2025-07-01T18:41:42Z
the edge 60 pro raw becomes slightly blurred even when focus is good , i compared it with the jpg shots ,

2025-07-03T07:47:34Z
Thoughts on edge 50 ultra? I‚Äôll be changing my iPhone 13 for it next week. Amazing photos btw!!

2025-06-13T20:58:54Z
Only way is to sell and buy a samsung phone again.

2025-06-13T22:18:55Z
Unfortunately Motorola doesn't offer this functionality. I had a S25 for a while. I was impressed by all the customisation Good Lock offers but in the end I am still happy with my edge 50 neo.

2025-06-13T21:00:43Z
Bruh you literally said when I holded?

Holded??

Wth man..

It's  held in first form and while using it in past tense it is hold 


You deserve neither samsung nor moto

2025-06-12T15:55:38Z
Sorry at first that I didn't read whole post but when you mentioned that flower was purple and moto was showing it as pink at that point I doubt the "pantone validated camera"

2025-06-13T16:01:13Z
Here on the Moto Edge 50 Neo, the best version for me that performed best was AGC 8.8, I didn't like this version 9.2.

2025-06-16T19:21:57Z
Yeah. Wanting microsd is why I'm shopping Motorola after my Samsung A54. It's basically between the Edge 60 regular and G86 Power now because of it.

2025-06-16T19:02:38Z
The better internals probably take more space so it'd be harder to add the little bit of extra space for an SD card reader and they didn't bother to save money

2025-06-16T19:20:28Z
Hello u/Purocco,

I hear your frustration about the Moto Edge 60 Pro lacking a microSD slot while other models have it, especially with its great processor. It's a valid concern!

Manufacturers often skip microSD slots on higher-end phones for reasons like:

* **Faster internal storage:** Top-tier phones use much quicker built-in storage.
* **Design & space:** It frees up room for other components like bigger batteries or advanced cameras.

I'll definitely pass your feedback along to our team. We understand expandable storage is a big deal for many users! -Jess

2025-06-14T10:49:46Z
That's pretty good ig I get around 3-4hrs on gaming

2025-06-14T21:57:02Z
Hi u/gandalf--the-grey, thank you for your feedback, it's good to see that with those conditions your phone is still running at 50%, that is still a pretty good screen-on time usage. Let me know if you need assistance or have any questions. I'd be happy to help. -Carlos

2025-06-17T01:02:29Z
The case should somewhat try to take inside a little bit of the display, the side bumps are good but the screen protection also is equally important...

2025-06-09T08:59:36Z
Maybe it's when the screen switches refresh rate? Try lock it and see if it still happens

2025-06-11T16:12:01Z
I have the same phone with the same problem. Flickering occurs after 1 sec that i touch my screen. There are a lot of users out there with the same problem but motorola/lenovo does not care, See [this from lenovo forum](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/motorola-edge-50-pro/Screen-flickering-after-Android-15-update/m-p/5354054?page=1).

I must say that decreasing refresh rate to 60hz, problem goes away.

2025-06-14T21:18:35Z
Hi u/t00043480. Thank you for reaching out, and we‚Äôre sorry to hear about the battery problems on your Edge 50 Fusion. It‚Äôs definitely not expected for your phone to drop 20% battery without active use, especially with background activity already restricted and no heavy apps like Reddit, X, or Facebook installed. We appreciate your efforts in trying to troubleshoot this already. 

Here are some **probing questions** to help better diagnose the battery drain:

1. How long have you had the phone, and when did you first notice the battery drain problem?
2. Did the battery performance change after a recent software update or app installation?
3. Is the battery drain consistent throughout the day, or does it happen more rapidly during specific periods?
4. Are you using **Wi-Fi**, **mobile data**, **Bluetooth**, or **location services** continuously?
5. Is **5G** enabled, and are you in an area with a weak or fluctuating signal?
6. Have you installed any third-party apps recently, even if they‚Äôre not in active use?

In the meantime, Boot into **Safe Mode** to check if a third-party app might be the cause:

* Press and hold the **Power button**.
* Tap and hold **Power off**, then select **Reboot to Safe Mode**.
* Use the phone for a few hours and see if the battery still drains.

If it improves in Safe Mode, a third-party app may be causing the drain even without background activity. -Carlos

2025-06-12T13:13:44Z
Did you check battery usage by hour?

2025-06-10T04:48:29Z
I don't know if this helps, but for me Ram boost is turned off

2025-06-09T15:48:20Z
On the most high end model of the series, it does. Everything below that, I'll have to disagree.

2025-06-09T13:43:48Z
Me watching this on 60 fusionüíÄ

2025-06-09T13:31:20Z
They have not stated what exactly happened. If the phone was on charge, what charger, was there damage, battery bulge etc. So, hard to make any conclusions.

2025-06-09T13:57:56Z
What is it with blaming the youtubers . Do u want every youtuber to take responsibility of the product u buy  from ur own money ?

2025-06-09T17:56:49Z
This can happen to any phone, it's all about the context of the situation.

What charger was being used? Was there any damage to the handset? Had it been dropped? Was there any liquid damage? Was it left on charge in a hot environment (like a car)? Are the electrics where the phone was charging safe?

There are more questions than answers, and there is almost definitely more to this situation than meets the eye.

2025-06-09T15:29:04Z
From 2-3 days im getting daydreams that my phone moto edge 60 fusion gonna explode and now im hearing this üíÄ

2025-06-09T13:55:30Z
Wasn't there another guy on this subreddit itself whose edge 50 pro melted down from overheating? is Moto facing battery issues or something?

2025-06-09T14:12:54Z
Well any phone can blast if the lithium-ion battery is damaged, the bigger question is what actually caused that.

2025-06-09T21:43:35Z
I remember when this happened in India with a CMF Phone 1. The dude crashed his motorbike, pierced the cell and they were raging at Nothing for a full acknowledgement and response.¬†


You guys seem to use your phones in extreme ways, don't be surprised when a Lithium battery explodes when abused.. it's chemistry.

2025-06-09T14:54:02Z

2025-06-10T04:34:19Z
Harsh comment but I call cap on this...

If there was a life threatening blast like he's saying, his hands should be way more injured than that...
There is some over exaggeration or even maybe BaitIng here.

Anyways the type of charger, under what conditions and what led to this situation should be investigated by the MOTO team

2025-06-09T17:03:43Z
A blast.. What kind of blast?

2025-06-09T15:38:02Z
I'm glad you're ok, and I hate that your phone dies; but Youtubers did not build or manufacture your phone. If your phone is faulty put the blame where it belongs, with the manufacturer. I'm really glad you're ok!

2025-06-09T16:13:12Z
Recent Moto phones heat like crazy so much so that I fear sometimes using my phone when it gets really hot just with simple social media scrolling and no other background apps running. I have an Edge 50 Fusion. Motorola should focus on providing cooling solutions in their phones over making them really slim with curved displays.

2025-06-09T17:33:01Z
I have an Edge 40 neo, it happened a few times that it got very hot to the point of burning my hand.

2025-06-10T01:58:28Z
Need more details to know if it's real or staged

2025-06-10T05:17:46Z
Is this info even verified!?

2025-06-10T06:16:34Z
I think I'll stick to my 50 Fusion, though probably because it's in India I say it's a heat related issue.

2025-06-11T11:00:43Z
Well.. was the unit in pristine condition when this happened, or was it badly damaged prior to it?

2025-06-13T03:02:03Z
Phone name really stands up for it

2025-06-30T10:17:48Z
Not the first time when such reports are made. Have there being a official response by Motorola? I think motorola is handling their software poorly. During heavy gaming my battery can reach over 50C. Without any thermal protections this could be invitation for a fire.

2025-06-09T19:16:28Z
Well, how else sre you gonna get fusion?

2025-06-09T16:47:50Z
That phone was a Mediatek, I've had a Snapdragon and no phone has ever exploded on me or anything like that. I prefer a Snapdragon because having a Mediatek is dangerous and they suffer from overheating or They can explode

2025-06-09T18:24:12Z
Well this is why they are not introducing the nuclear batteries to use in phones.. Cuz they know that somewhere someone will do the BOOM! And do his society KABOOM!..

For me the most important thing is the battery life, I don't want to update and be affected since you can't go back to a previous version.

So my question is how about the battery performance did it get better or worse or is it the same?

2025-06-29T10:40:35Z
Lol what did you just say!!! "Haptics got improved" bro...the vibration feel low after A15 update.... whether its a call or just typing in keyboard...it feel very low!!! Plus one thing to notice that they just broke the speaker configuration....the speaker now loose its richness... earlier it used to be crisp and bassy....well now its sound more like a "fata hua baas". And its a glitchy ui... I don't know how you have used it but in 24 hr i feel like its much worse than even A14 update.... The only good about this update is the lockscreen customisation...apart from that all are just shit....no improvement in camera...still used the same version app of camera in this update....no actual feature added into it.....Maa ksm this is the last shit bought from motorola....no matter what or how expensive device you buy from this shitty brand....they will anyhow make sure that the device will become crap in a year or two...so that in frustration you opt for their new modelsü•≤

2025-06-21T04:12:03Z
Updating the phone nowadays is like injecting the bugs and infection into it.. People are greedy and craving for updates I don't know why... When a device is working perfectly fine, and you aren't missing out a whole lot of things with the other version, then why mess around with it and invite bugs, degraded camera quality, green lines, heating, lagging, boot loop etc etc..... Never touch if it works. Or loose it. Brands are anyways making bad updates intentionally to damage previous models and to sell their new models...

It'd be cool if they make a Moto Edge plus (2025). Give it maybe a snapdragon 8 gen 4 or 8 gen elite.

Because compare to the edge plus 2023, the edge 2024 and 2025 just have like snapdragon 7 gen 3 or 7s gen something.

2025-06-25T21:14:59Z
Motorola said that they would give Android 16 to every 2024 device except the moto g 5g and the g play. Btw I'm using a 2024 moto g power 5g and am expecting Android 16 in the coming months bc of the variability of the haptic feedback for deleting notifications and what not

Dude I bought this phone thinking I'll receive regular updates considering the price at least üòÇ, but damn Moto has disappointed me soo much I'm actually moving away now. I need regular updates man, I have finally realised I am an 'updates' guy and if Moto can't deliver it I ain't staying here. Only using this phone for the next few months till I can afford a new one and then I'm OUT!

Though samsung mid range is a bit late to receive android 15 update, it's pretty consistent for security patches and I love how smooth my brother's samsung A55 performing after the update. Thing is I appreciate Moto still keeping headphone jack and micro sd card slot.

2025-06-18T07:37:27Z
Android15 is launched for edge40 today. (retjp)

2025-06-17T18:32:23Z
Is the update still scheduled or is it not coming?

2025-06-18T01:34:51Z
Stable A15 update has started to roll out in a few countries. You'll get it by the end of this month.

2025-06-18T11:13:36Z
I also have to the edge 40.....do we get hello moto along with A15 or is it just for the new phones?

2025-06-17T18:48:03Z
As far as I understand, the edge 40 with its bimonthly updates is within time to receive the June one at the end of this month or at the beginning of July we will be lucky if together with the June security patch we receive Android 15 with hello UI Yo tambi√©n tengo el Edge 40 en el Canal de software TIMIT y tambi√©n tengo el parche de seguridad de abril.

2025-06-17T19:34:59Z
At least your last update is from this year. My Edge 40 neo hasn't received an update since October last year ü•¥

2025-06-17T22:10:53Z
Sometimes its good to use the Motorola Software Fix tool for windows and check if an update is available.

2025-06-18T06:28:06Z
Same thing happening to me. never buying Motorola again

2025-06-18T09:05:34Z
I just got the update - should i do it? Any bugs anyone knows?

2025-06-18T11:45:42Z
We got f man ... No updates nothing... Sad 30000 inr just wastedüòµüòµ

2025-06-18T12:10:35Z
so that's why my Edge 40 neo doesn't get the updates

2025-06-18T12:16:17Z
I saw that someone in India already received Android 15 a few hours ago.

2025-06-18T12:58:06Z
Yes, it seems that in India they are already receiving Android 15, there are two people on Twitter who confirmed it a few minutes ago

2025-06-18T19:50:12Z
New update: on It's just a matter of time before it reaches us.

2025-06-19T22:51:36Z
Yeah, the updates on this phone sucks, I can't believe a g54 already have android 15 and the edge 40 no.

2025-06-17T22:52:01Z
What I'm talking about y'all overreacting with updates you want all these updates go get a pixel phone your guaranteed to get all the updates stop stressing yourself out over it

2025-06-17T20:05:44Z
I have the Moto edge+ 2023 and received the latest May security patch update which fixed the heating although that didn't affect me that much It seems that Motorola prefers my country and the United States and I see that updates are arriving late to you. I get the updates first and I see that you get them weeks late ü§£It's a good thing I'm from North America. Here we only accept unlocked and good quality Motorola Snapdragons.

2025-06-18T01:50:21Z
I can't access my apps for work because I don't have the latest security patch, which is annoying. This is the first Motorola (moto g 2025) I've owned. Previous phones have all been Pixels and now I'm missing the frequent updates.

2025-06-18T03:35:33Z
Motorola is developing a sophisticated nuclear missile... that's why they are unable to provide any kind of updates.....all their workforce is busy on developing that missile

2025-06-18T06:15:31Z
My previous device was a redmi note 9. Blud started on android 10 and lasted till android 13, used that one for 4 years.
Good ol days

2025-06-18T13:03:44Z
I have one... and it got updated to Android 15...like 4 months ago... in fact, today I got the June security patch as part of the bimonthly security updates.

So, it's inconsistent across continents; I got this from the Indian subcontinent...

2025-06-19T00:06:56Z
Motorola is a bit slower than others but it can also be affected by the carrier you have as well. Unless its unlocked, you literally have to wait for Motorola to do their thing, pass to carriers and wait for carrier to put their spin on the update before pushing it out.

2025-06-26T08:10:00Z
Can someone help me? For some reason mine is still on Android 13 saying there are no new updates.

2025-06-18T03:30:58Z
I saved myself by like 12hrs... I ordered moto edge 50 on Flipkart and it already reached my nearest hub... But I cancelled it by this thought and got vivo t3 pro... Today I see so many complains on moto like no update, lagging camera, sim card problems... Someone like me who depend on this phone for everything from online studies to snack time entertainment... It would have been a nightmare

2025-06-17T18:00:43Z
Same here with 50 fusion

2025-06-17T22:52:44Z
You don't see me overreacting oh I don't have Android 16 yet no I'm patiently I'm going to wait on my Motorola G stylus 2025 5G

2025-06-11T13:10:22Z
Moto phones are generally clean with no extra apps and the ui is also good close to stock android 
If we talk about the cameras of moto edge 50 neo so I'll say They are good üëç have a great camera setup with telephoto camera , Image quality is and the potraits from telephoto camera are lit ‚ô•Ô∏è videos are also great as per the price point 
There may be some minor issues here and there but you can simply ignore them 

Display is awesome, have  great colors and the text looks sharper too 
Processor isn't that blast in the price range but it can handle your daily usage and even you can play some games on it too like pugb in 60fps and Codm in 90 
Battery is great for 4310 mah but if you are a heavy user then you have to charge your phone in the evening otherwise  on  mild usage it can give a battery backup of a whole day 
So now I have given all the info about the 50 neo 
So enjoy your device üëç

2025-06-11T13:31:24Z
Hoe? Moto phones are like Google Pixels without the overheating issues. I personally think Motorola is a better value than Samsung and OnePlus.

2025-06-11T13:38:37Z
Just go for it dude. The edge 50 neo is amazing to say the least. Exceptional display, UI, cameras. Decent haptics. Semi compact form factor. The only compromises you'll make are the processor and the front camera. Battery life is more than sufficient. Also great in-hand feel. A solid 9/10 phone for the price.

2025-06-11T13:24:40Z
I have too the 50 Neo.  
No return period?   
I think it's a good phone. 5 years of updates, the rest only just 2-3 years.      
Tip: use the "pro" mode on the camera, if the main camera makes too many changes to the photos. and for selfies I only use pro mode.      
If you got the phone, turn off the "Ram boost" in the settings

2025-06-11T14:52:35Z
I have edge 50 neo 12/512...

really good phone

2025-06-11T13:34:36Z
Can't say I have any complaints about mine had it about 9 months now and it's doing what I want it to do very well, the swipe instead of home buttons can be a little annoying at times but is generally ok.

2025-06-11T16:00:25Z
Hoi  üòé 

The 512GB variant for ‚Ç¨250? Go for it! I've been using the Neo 50 for the past 6 months. It's not a performance-oriented phone, but it's more than enough for daily use. The camera is good, and the battery life is above average ‚Äî especially impressive given how compact it is.

Btw, I also live in the Netherlands! ;)

2025-06-11T13:08:48Z
Edge 50 pro and it has been great.¬† Reminds me of a xiaomi/poco, fast and great screen.

2025-06-11T13:20:57Z
Never had any problem with them relative to anything else. Some of them are expensive for what you get vs other options when it comes to MSRP,  but when you consider actual street prices, those same phones can be very good values, which is the main reason I keep coming back.

2025-06-11T13:36:14Z
Can't speak to ordering directly from their website but my experience of recent Motorola phones is very good.

Stock-ish Android, with a few tasteful and useful additions. Very good standby battery drain. Phones feel high quality for their price point.

I will say the cameras are a bit limited, but they're not terrible.

2025-06-11T14:55:58Z
They are underrated, solid pieces of hardware.   I own two, but havent used them as my main device so my experience is limited.

  
They aren't quite as fully featured (in terms of software) as a samsung flagship or pixel, but they are quality devices.

2025-06-11T15:25:54Z
I thought it would be better than sex but since I have no sexual experience I cannot compare. Its good but not great. Specs are great on paper well except for the processor. But software updates being slow is a concern. I don't think we will get Android 16 anytime soon.

2025-06-11T15:48:22Z
Problem with Motorola phones is Motorola itself. Don't expect much alacrity with updates.

2025-06-11T14:55:01Z
I own an Edge 40 Neo for almost 2 yrs and I am very happy with every single decision that Motorola has made for this device! I only had an issue with battery draining recently but it got fixed with an Instagram and Google Play System update. I only wish Motorola could extend the Android update on 40 Edge series for a bit longer...

2025-06-11T15:36:14Z
I have a g62 5g (given to me by my Company) and I'm extremely happy. I use It all day and the battery is top!

2025-06-11T17:14:58Z
The edge 50 neo is a pretty good phone, except for the poor microphone quality. The sound of the recorded video's with more noise is terrible. For example, when filming an airplane or a rally car, the sound is like the phone is under water. After 3 months and trying to use other camera apps and no response from Motorola, i'm switching back to Samsung. As an aviation lover it's unusable for that reason.

2025-06-11T21:51:41Z
We have two Moto phones. A RAZR + 24 and a Stylus 24. Both have been great. My RAZR just got Android 15 yesterday. I've had Motos on and off for a long time and I think they are better than ever.

2025-06-12T01:05:46Z
My first motorola phone was a Moto Z play, it had battery issues, it wouldn't last more than 4 hours of use, not even with the battery mod.

Currently I'm using an Edge 60 pro and the battery is amazing. It easily lasts over a day, even if you use it frequently. The cameras are pretty decent and you can play demanding games without burning your hands, same thing with taking videos and photos for a long time. I couldn't be happier with this phone and I love it, I came from a S23 and I don't miss a thing.

Now, consider that each phone is different, the hardware has a big impact on how the phone feels overall. On top of that, there's always a small chance an unit might be defective (And that's not exclusive from motorola, but any brand in general). For years Motorola had a weird era where their cameras were bad, they used oudated components, their update policy was unclear and their prices weren't competitive. They started to aim the right direction with the edge 30 series and they've been improving ever since.

Just consider that Motorola releases different versions of their devices based on their market. For example: The edge 40 pro (for latinamerica and europe) was named Moto edge+ (2023) on the states. The "international" version had a 4500 mAh battery with 12GB RAM whereas the american version had 8GB RAM and 5100mAh. The recent Edge 50 fusion uses a Snapdragon 7s gen 2 in India, but it uses a SD 6 Gen 1 in latinamerica. It's not the first time they do this and it won't be the last one either.

Always look at the specs that are IN your Country's Motorola website, that is the only reliable source of information for the specs. You can always check and compare the displayed info with CPU-Z once you get your device.

They're a reliable and widely available alternative to pixel phones, their UI is one of the closest to look and feel like Android Stock and you can find them everywhere, unlike pixel's that have a smaller market.

2025-06-12T03:36:23Z
Love my edge 2022, have a 2024 to swap to soon as well.

2025-06-11T13:06:45Z
Bought the same device for my mother couple of months back and we are pretty happy with it. It's a nice device.

2025-06-11T13:17:35Z
I love my edge 50 neo. Price/value is incredible. Not a big fan of the cameras, especially in low light, but definitely usable.
Battery life is very good, form factor kind of perfect. 
Yeah, enjoy your new phone.

2025-06-11T13:34:08Z
Very nice phone, i have the 12/512 GB version, really nice hardware considering the price i bought it to.(200 euro thru my cell carrier).

Only drawback is the software suite.

Taboola live lock screen needs to be removed using android adb, if it gets installed( crapware that sells your information to advertisement companies) and drains battery.( Advertisments on your lock screen whats not to like).

Slow camera software suite according to many users.

Annoying notifications from moto apps, just disable them as with meta apps.

2025-06-11T13:39:10Z
Though they offer great VFM, Moto phones are notoriously famous for having issues in long term usage.

2025-06-11T14:40:14Z
I bought Motorola G72 2 years ago and still use it. It's great phone, pretty fast CPU even today, 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB internal storage, and its Dual SIM, which was important for me. Display is amazing (OLED) and perfectly readable even at direct sun, camera is good but not great, sound is decent considering the price (it even has stereo speakers). Battery life is excellent, and I only need to charge once in 2 to 3 days while using the phone quite a lot. No powerbanks needed for full day GPS/maps heavy trips, ever.

It is definitely reliable phone, I have never had any issues with it from hardware point of view. The system is stable too (upgraded to Android 13, but sadly no upgrade after that so far), the only issue is that by default it installs some crappy apps every once in a while automatically and without consent.. Fortunately this can be turned off relatively easily in settings.

Apart from that nuisance with it installing unwanted apps, its just great phone, which feels much more premium compared to what it cost (it cost me only about 240 euros at that time).

2025-06-11T16:00:42Z
It depends on the model line, the G series is most reliable, I have 4 Moto G, see my flair, they are all excellent to use, and build.

I've not had luck with whatever flagship of the year they had, the last I owned was the Z series.  I've used their flagships maybe 10 years, continuously, upgrading from one to another, and always problems enough that I was about to switch to another brand.  

The G series is conservative, using well proven old established tech so everything tends to work as you expect.  The only new tech in them often are the SoCs and 5G radios.  

I've had issues with the quality of trustpilot reviews, so I don't rely on them.  I don't think Moto is 1.5 stars, for Lenovo Moto and its complaints, the minimum I'd rate them is 3 stars, mostly for the troublesome flagship phones.  The G series is 4.5 stars IMHO, its minus 0.5 stars because the factory support is spotty other than the self help web site [ which is excellent 5 stars] and Android security updates are very short [ 2 yrs vs 4+ years with Samsung] and sometimes those updates causes problems reported with some users, I've never had any.

2025-06-11T16:21:42Z
from a moto user, please get a Samsung, worst, unoptimized software, late updates and never gets security updates on time

2025-06-11T16:23:08Z
you a hoe...but yeah, phones are good

2025-06-11T16:53:02Z
Considering value Motorola does disappoint, recommend...

2025-06-11T19:31:24Z
I have had a couple of Motorola phones g85 and Fusion 50. Both are great. I sold the g85 to keep the 50. No regrets using Motorola. Phone does what it's supposed to do, camera is good, battery life long, curved screen doesn't bother me.

Motorolas have a lot of bang for their buck.

2025-06-11T20:37:59Z
I have an Edge 40 with nova launcher and i find It great, great value for Money. I wish it was a little smaller like 6 inches and a little lighter

2025-06-11T20:45:51Z
Been happy with my Stylus 2024. It's a mid range that just works. 

My Pixel 7 pro bit the dust. Pixel was bad quality.

2025-06-11T21:13:47Z
The phone has a 8GB and 12GB version. The specs pages on the Motorola websites can be incomplete at times. The sale page clearly states 12GB so that's what you should receive. If not file a complaint or ask for a refund.

Did you order the poop color?

2025-06-12T00:13:39Z
I've had a Motorola phone for the last 8 years just because when you shake it, the light comes on.

2025-06-12T03:12:31Z
Well, it is my experience that they are very good dual phones. I have a moto g6 from years ago and I currently have a g75 and it doesn't heat up at all and I play for a maximum of 2 hours.

2025-06-12T08:30:20Z
Great phone in every way, only one problem with the sensitivity of the touchscreen and the recognition of finger Scanner. Probably a bug wich can be fixed with a update, hopefully Motorola do something about it very soon ...
OR is there a screen protector already on the screen from factory , i put a good screen protector on the screen ....maby thats the problem but you can't see if there is one already on the screen if there is one its so thin .....there was a little scratch on my screen thats why i have put a good screenprotector with good sensitivity on the screen , bit the problem of the fingerprint scanner stays and now and the the touchscreen dosn't react by touching it it very anouyin!!!

2025-06-12T09:26:49Z
Bitch I got a Razr 50 Ultra and it fkn whips, probably the best smartphone I've ever owned all-round.

2025-06-12T09:31:02Z
I have only owned Motorola phones for the past 10 or so years, currently have an Edge Fusion 20 but coincidently just ordered a Neo 50 on the EOFY sales for only $349. I was contemplating going for a Pixel similar to that my wife has but just cannot bring myself to pay more than double the price for pretty much the same thing. The battery on my 4 year old fusion that I paid maybe $400 for is better than on my wife's $1000 phone. Motorola all the way, best bang for your buck out there.

2025-06-12T11:35:23Z
I can only RECOMMEND.

2025-06-23T16:37:37Z
Can anyone tell me the maximum Wifi speed that beats the Moto G75???  Has anyone already taken the test? I really need to know this before buying.

2025-06-11T13:29:26Z
Phone seems okay after a few weeks of use. 

Software is littered with bugs left and right that make it hard to enjoy the device.

2025-06-11T14:11:19Z
Pretty bad experience with my moto edge 40, often I used to get system UI not responding error

2025-06-11T15:37:08Z
Nice typo. üòÜ 

And to answer the question...they're crap. 

But if looking for a good budget phone, the Edge and some other models are better than say Samsung and iPhone..but very iffy. Nord OnePlus was actually good, surprisingly, but they're phasing out now. 
Samsung is just bad news all around. Never ever had luck with Sansungs over the years.
If you get a newer Motorola, you might wanna wait a few months until the quirks and issues get noticed and see what's what.

2025-06-24T06:06:13Z
motorola has been going downhill since the global test for ricardo.

2025-06-24T04:45:33Z
Same thing happened with me the camera just wouldn't open

2025-06-24T04:48:00Z
Classic Motorola feature

2025-06-24T09:23:57Z
Did you try restarting your phone

2025-06-24T11:37:22Z
Hey, I had the same problem a while back and realized that it happened when I had the Creator Toolkit enabled.  Check that option.

2025-06-24T17:18:01Z
Use gcam as a back up.

2025-06-24T18:05:51Z
This has happened on my iPhone 16 pro max it‚Äôs not just Motorola

2025-06-24T09:06:37Z
Yeah you are right üëç. Any thing worst you imagine moto has capability to do so. Lagging, battery issue,App crash, no proper update only promises, home screen stuck etc

2025-06-24T15:00:25Z
Same thing happens to me, but reopening camera once sorts it

2025-06-24T16:03:18Z
hey man out of all the problems i complain about on my neo, yours stands out. perhaps im not harsh enough with motorola for their substandard OS, ui troubles, battery drain and camera dysfunctionality

2025-06-24T17:25:11Z
Im the user of moto edge 40, I faced All the problem in this phone Not yet A15 update

2025-06-24T18:57:40Z
Not related to this, but my edge 50 neo camera is also been laggy since the past month or so. It was really snappy when I bought it. Maybe the updates f\*\*ked up everything. I was so happy with my choice, but now I'm having second thoughts. :(

2025-06-24T22:23:58Z
Moto had these problems since long time and it Just ruins the whole experience. 

In my g54 5g i face issues with media player, different types of video codec etc etc while my 6 year old REALME 3 PRO does everything better than the moto

2025-06-24T23:12:29Z
Same thing on G84. üòü

2025-06-25T06:15:32Z
Welcome to the moto club

2025-06-25T08:59:23Z
I‚Äôve had the same problem multiple times with my iPhone

2025-06-25T16:25:40Z
I am aware that Motorola update policy sucks big time,but at least they don't give buggy updates.

I don't know whether the Edge 50 Neo got a problematic update,if so they should fix it by the next update,which would take a while anyways.

At least with my Edge 40,I did not face any notable bugs or issues that inhibited usage.


PS - Talking about spontaneous pet clicks,I managed to snag a cat today.

2025-06-26T04:01:30Z
Moto's downfall started before reaching peak ü•≤

2025-06-26T18:12:00Z
Glad i use open camera

2025-06-29T17:37:19Z
Is anyone having trouble with the OK Google voice command after the latest update on the Motorola Edge 40 Neo? From what I see, Motorola is just getting ready to make new phones and doesn't give a damn about the old one.

2025-06-24T06:08:06Z
Same happened with me too.. I have moto edge 40 neo 
I have  after restart the phone & issue solved

2025-06-24T21:30:16Z
In Brazil, Motorola became synonymous with an unreliable product, precisely for this reason.

I've had several Motorolas, but these types of problems with the camera, error in the default launch and audio problems made me discouraged from the brand.

I considered buying the edge 50 ultra, or even the RAZR 50 ultra, but after doing some basic research the idea didn't seem so good anymore.

2025-06-16T06:57:16Z
Great battery life. 


Moto edge 60 PRO

2025-06-16T06:58:05Z
It has to be the edge 60 pro

2025-06-16T07:17:24Z
50 neo fs fuck mine too

2025-06-16T08:50:46Z
It's the moto g stylus 5g 2024

2025-06-16T10:43:03Z
Moto edge 50 Fusion?

2025-06-16T10:44:42Z
Stylus and Edge can get 12Hrs on WiFi consistently.

2025-06-16T14:54:42Z
Motorola G Power 2024.

2025-06-13T11:38:27Z
Android 16? 
I'm using a 40 neo and haven't even got a security update since February. I'm pretty sure this model isn't getting even A15 before the end of this year at this point.

2025-06-13T10:56:47Z
Idk why are people on a hurry to get android/security updates...unless there is a major bug i dnt thnk we need to care so much....i used android 13 for almost 2 years no issue wt so ever

2025-06-13T10:46:41Z
Hi, where you reach them.

Thank you for asking 50 Neo       
We maybe get Android 16 sooner, while others stay on Android 14

2025-06-13T19:31:04Z
Not even Google has fully released android 16. They just called it 16, gave it new security stuff, a few tricks and that's it. The true update with Expressive stuff is still in beta for pixels and will probably arrive around September.

2025-06-13T18:08:34Z
Oh great outside of terminal and The DEX feature(we already have) what's the big deal about A16 again?

2025-06-14T02:19:51Z
A16 is already pushing out.

2025-06-13T19:07:43Z
I would expect us to have Android 16 in December or January, I have the edge 50 fusion and some started receiving the Android 15 beta in November 2024, I received the stable update on February 14, 2025. In addition, registrations are currently open to access the closed betas that will be published soon, although in the registration process they make it clear that it is strictly prohibited to publish screenshots and talk about these beta versions.

2025-06-13T11:22:08Z
They're still rolling out the Android 15 update, it's very unlikely for them to roll out 2 android updates back to back. Otherwise they may as well skip A15 and go straight to A16.

What does A16 bring anyway? Live notifications... And little else.

2025-06-13T16:48:31Z
my brother's moto razr 2024 didnt even get android 15 yet

2025-06-13T19:18:05Z
I'm actually glad there is still hope for getting A15 and they didn't just abandon devices and jump to A16.

2025-06-14T06:58:57Z
Yeah I have a 2024 stylus and I'm still waiting for Android 15.

2025-06-14T12:27:51Z
As a former Motorola user 
Don't take the support team's responses seriously. They don't have any accurate information or even any knowledge. All they do is copy and paste.

2025-06-15T15:59:05Z
Android 16 isn't a huge upgrade at all I've tested it out on a few devices mostly Pixel. Once it hits Motorola devices the upgrade will be minor although probably better than Pixel

2025-06-13T12:37:08Z
Bro the pixel just got update of android 16 2 days ago,just keep patience, it will come eventually. I have edge 50 Pro and I got android 15 within 3 months of it releasing i.e around 3 or four months before samsung ok.

2025-07-01T09:31:22Z
The problem is not that. It's that Google X. A long time ago, a vulnerability report on Meltdown and Spectre. Software fix for this vulnerability. What is core isolation leads to a drop in performance of all processors. It is less noticeable on top processors, more noticeable on budget ones. This is a problem did not miss the architecture ARM. Which is also prone to these vulnerabilities. At the architectural level, no processor manufacturer in the world has wanted to fix this problem. That's why we have constant security patches to mitigate this vulnerability. Moreover, Mediatek processors have big problems with heat dissipation coefficients.

2025-07-01T10:47:25Z
Also must be mentioned that these benchmarks are highly inaccurate most of the times...

2025-07-01T09:27:36Z
15 use more resources i think

2025-07-01T10:21:32Z
What about antutu? Does it score at least the same?

2025-07-01T16:44:29Z
Do it. Else you will think about it and waste time.

2025-07-03T05:27:15Z
To be sure,it could be due to this specific benchmark,but the performance otherwise is pretty normal.

A15 could be gauging the system performance taking into battery considerations and heat into account,after a while,the performance will return to normal.

I am myself a Edge 40 user,and recieved the A15 update on June 30th,and I did note that the device took much longer to recharge the first time around,so it may be an optimisation thing after all.

2025-07-01T09:42:01Z
Mention the battery percentage in each test, not the date because it's irrelevant for those of us reading your post. The CPU throttles under low battery conditions, which could be why you're seeing lower scores. When I ran the benchmarks I didn't see a difference.

2025-06-30T20:00:11Z
üìà Benchmark Results

Test Type	Android 14	Android 15	Difference

Vulkan	4899	>> 5637	üîº +738 (~15%)
OpenCL	4744	>> 5453	üîº +709 (~15%)


‚öôÔ∏è Device Specs

Chipset: MediaTek Dimensity 8020 (Mali-G77 MC9 GPU)

Model: Motorola Edge 40

Kernel Jump: 4.19 ‚Üí 6.6 (Big deal!)


üß† What Changed?

The GPU performance saw a noticeable boost after upgrading to Android 15.

Likely due to the newer Linux 6.6 kernel, which brings updated GPU drivers and improved Vulkan/OpenCL stack support.

No hardware changes ‚Äî this is purely from software/kernel optimizations.


üöÄ TL;DR:

Updating to Android 15 gave my Edge 40 a solid ~15% GPU uplift. Great job by Motorola & MediaTek for keeping midrange devices feeling snappy post-update!

2025-06-30T22:33:17Z
Can you give me some tips to improve the smooth on my Moto Edge 40?

2025-07-01T01:27:01Z
Have you see any change in camera?

2025-07-01T03:52:05Z
Any bugs Or Issues???

2025-07-01T08:19:15Z
Do I need to reset my phone after update?
Some guys in the edge 40 telegram community said it feels a lot smoother after resetting the phone after update?

2025-07-01T09:31:16Z
Can you actually play wuthering waves on edge 40, I tried genshin once, it was laggy af

2025-07-09T10:03:17Z
Fuck these type of gpu cpu score in real life I am experiencing worst performance on Android 15 thermal throttling was before but now it's on peak with latest asshole update 
Fuck you motorola. 
Biggest piece of dog shit motorola edge 40 and their software developer team.
Fuck whore company moto.
I'm not able to use my device because it keeps overheating, even though it's the rainy season.

2025-06-30T20:16:16Z
I agree Android 15 did come with some gains I have basically the edge 40 pro I got a score of 8778 on the GPU OPEN CL score. crushed it a higher score when compared to other devices running the same chipset like the Galaxy s 23 plus.   But with the update to hello ui  some things and options are different then my edge 2024 that's on Android 14 that came with hello ui

2025-06-23T08:01:15Z
Edge 50 neo or Edge 60 Stylus

2025-06-23T18:34:44Z
I am using both Samsung A55 and Motorola edge 50 neo. Samsung feels like a more premium device to me, with its solid build, smoother/better polished UI, faster overall response, way better sound. But it's huge and heavy, I prefer carrying Moto in my pocket over Samsung, and also Moto has a more capable camera, but not by much, and it lags, so the overall experience is usually worse. I haven't noticed any bugs on Samsung, while Moto has quite a few annoying bugs.
So buy something of a higher level, like Pro or Ultra, if you want to feel an upgrade over Samsung A55, because edge 50 neo is somewhat on the same level, but it could be worse in many ways (yet I still would prefer Moto)

2025-06-23T08:09:57Z
I made a post of a link to a battery drain test video. Make of it what you will, because I know people have varying opinions and experiences with the neo. But I hope you are happy with your choice, whatever you decide to buy (also the video is from last year, and maybe the updates and Android 15 changed some things concerning battery life):
https://www.reddit.com/r/motorola/s/XhdPWCQH75

2025-06-23T10:40:01Z
If the time is not problem, wait the 60 Neo. It will probably be released in early September. and maybe the price of 50 Neo will be cheaper too      
Btw if you buy 50 Neo choose the mocha mousse color, this was released later, and so maybe there are fewer errors

2025-07-04T13:57:48Z
I have an Edge 40 Pro and the same thing happens to me when updating to A15, they don't provide any solution.

2025-07-04T13:30:25Z
This is not happening with me....same device

2025-07-04T14:51:23Z
Did you try restarting?
I remember something similar on my Motorola edge 50 fusion indian

2025-07-04T18:34:46Z
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

2025-07-04T21:31:51Z
Same here (G85 5G) since A15 update, and no fix for now.

2025-07-05T22:51:51Z
What is your software version?, I have the same device and it had the same bug, but it stopped occurring in update V1UU35H.15-41-6-5/V1UU35H.15-41-6-5-1(Respectively), which has the April 1st/May 1st package with stability improvements

2025-07-08T17:22:35Z
Same here, moto edge 40, this bug appeared after A15 update (V1TL35.73-60-3).

Sometimes it can be temporarily fixed by locking the phone and going to the notification bar on the lock screen while the music is playing.

2025-06-22T05:39:17Z
M satisfied with mine tho

2025-06-22T05:36:04Z
It's still interesting that I think it has a lot to do with CPU optimization.

2025-06-22T08:29:13Z
cool but imma wait for edge 60 neo

2025-06-22T10:26:33Z
I did 2 hrs gaming and it wnet from 77-32

2025-06-23T04:40:21Z
I have moto edge 50 fusion and i can confirm with gaming and heavy usage it give  7 hours+ battery backup easily

2025-06-20T06:04:11Z
It works with Wireless Charging. Ready for is now Smart Connect. And Smart Connect blows Dex out of the Water. It's very close to Windows and supports every resolution under the sun. It also lets you use the phone as Console with a Console Interface and as a Media Player. DeX hasn't even changed the design since the S8. I use both daily.

2025-06-20T04:29:01Z
Dex all the way. It works better than windows in terms of touch/tablet/portable setup

2025-06-20T10:06:20Z
I have no wireless charger, but I am fairly certain it will work.

To those claiming DeX is the only valid way to use glasses with an Android phone, check my comments here describing the experience and how it works (also check my conments to the replies): https://reddit.com/comments/1l0lbcm/comment/mvec5md

I think SmartConnect (ReadyFor does not exist anymore) is actually better than DeX with glasses in some regards because it supports 32:9 out of the box, and doesn't seem to be missing any features compared to DeX (though I never tried DeX).

2025-06-19T22:34:03Z
Go for Dex. Ready for is a failed product.

2025-07-04T09:37:06Z
Motorola edge 50 fusion here, and I have about the same issues with it.

2025-07-03T20:18:50Z
Hi u/niovhe, thank you for reaching out and for providing such a detailed and helpful report regarding the Bluetooth connectivity problem on your Motorola Edge 60 Pro. We truly appreciate your patience and the fact that you're willing to provide logs and further details. We'd like to gather a few more details so we can better assist you:

1.  Is this problem happening with multiple Bluetooth devices, or just one (e.g., car, headphones, speakers)?
2. Does the Bluetooth device disconnect immediately, or after a period of time or activity?
3. Are you using any battery optimization or app management settings that may interfere with Bluetooth (e.g., aggressive background restrictions, battery saver mode)?

In the meantime, please try to force reboot your phone and the device you are trying to connect with. Let me know if you see any changes. -Carlos

2025-07-03T22:22:17Z
RAZR Ultra 2025/60, no Bluetooth issues here either. 

No, all Motorola phones won't have Bluetooth issues.

Have you downloaded and installed all the various updates for your phone, from the Play Store (small system updates are available this way) and Settings>System & Security>System & Updates?

2025-07-04T05:27:49Z
Could it be incompatibility of Bluetooth versions?

2025-07-05T00:41:45Z
Back when I was looking to buy a Motorola, I wanted the G84. I really liked the Marshmallow Blue color. But I was told by someone who had just bought it that he was having Bluetooth issues like you mentioned. It seems there were quite a few complaints about it, and other models were also mentioned. Sometime later, I ended up getting the Edge 50 Fusion and had issues with my Alexa Auto on the second or third day. I reset wireless connections, which deleted my wifi passwords and Bluetooth devices, but I haven't had issues since. I've had it for about a year already.

2025-07-03T20:38:46Z
No problems at all with bluetooth (Edge 50 Neo).

2025-07-05T16:43:15Z
Go for edge 60 series

2025-07-05T13:59:44Z
Buying the last generation is good.  I would buy either the Razr or Edge on sale.

2025-07-05T13:54:30Z
Imo go for deals rather than models.

2025-07-06T01:32:40Z
Any edge 60 it's gonna be ok

2025-07-06T11:27:41Z
Buy Moto 

if you are ready to sacrifice some features you familiar with samsung 
Also ready to accept Motorola bugs in the name of software update....

Better Don't switch because your phone feel laggy just perform factory reset then everything fix.. unless if you have plenty of money don't know what to do then buy moto

2025-06-18T01:09:33Z
It's an Android bug, not even Motorola specifically

2025-06-18T01:21:01Z
It generally goes away by swiping up to hide the control center and then swiping down to bring it back.

2025-06-18T01:40:34Z
Tried restarting the device ? Definitely a bug

2025-06-18T06:33:09Z
Turn off pin Media player 

Settings>Sound & vibration > Media

2025-06-18T17:06:43Z
Hi u/Alert-Salad9580, thank you for sharing your concern. I understand how annoying it can be with those big spaces that don't show anything. Let me help you. Could you tell me how this started? Did it happen right after a software update? In the meantime, try to perform a force reboot the pressing the power button for 10 seconds until it restarts. Let me know if it still shows. -Carlos

2025-06-21T00:34:00Z
I have the same problem with my 50 Neo, I don't think there's a way to fix it.

2025-06-21T13:20:43Z
Yes!! This is a case of loose fitting of ui!! I would suggest you to start hammering from the notch side....till the ui gets adjusted tightly without any gaps

2025-06-11T09:15:14Z
App needed for services such as overload protection, optimized charging and other functions that need ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù, if you uninstall or disable it, these functions will disappear.

2025-06-11T10:59:53Z
Bludy ram management and optimization being named with AI...

2025-06-13T13:44:03Z
How get AI on moto edge 50 neo

2025-07-01T06:56:18Z
okay guys so my edge 50 neo's charge just dropped like bonkers yesterday and I searched which app consumed it, it turns out that this shit app has consumed more than 68% in last 24hrs what do I do

2025-06-10T13:57:26Z
Haven't seen Call Record in a stock Motorola phone for several years...

2025-06-10T14:01:20Z
It is available in my Moto edge 50 pro

2025-06-10T14:34:22Z
Available in mine tooo

2025-06-12T20:31:25Z
Hi u/IWasASperm, thank you for reaching out to us. If you're using the **Motorola Edge 2024**, the **call recording feature** may be missing or hidden based on your **region, carrier, and software version**. Motorola phones **do not always include native call recording**, especially in markets where it is restricted for legal or privacy reasons.

# Here's how to check if call recording is available on your Motorola Edge 2024:

# ‚úÖ 1. Check in the Dialer (Phone) App

* Open the **Phone app**.
* Call any number or your voicemail.
* Look at the in-call screen for a **"Record" button** ‚Äî it may be in the menu.
   * If you see it, tap it to start/stop recording.
   * If it's **missing**, the feature is likely **disabled by region or carrier**.

# ‚úÖ 2. Search Settings for "Call Recording"

* Open **Settings** \> search for **"Call Recording"**
* If it's not found, it‚Äôs either not supported or blocked by your device‚Äôs software configuration.

Let me know if this helps. -Carlos

2025-06-20T20:39:31Z
Hi u/Wiseguy-_- thank you for reaching out to us. Thinkphone does not support LDAC or LHDC, only SBC, aptX, **aptX HD**, and other Qualcomm codecs. Now, for Moto G86, focus on processor, display, storage, and IP rating‚Äîthey don‚Äôt list Bluetooth codecs. Let me know if you have further questions. -Carlos

2025-06-20T21:50:45Z
I recently got a 2023 Thinkphone (EU). The developer options for audio codecs suggests LDAC exists (as well as LHDC V1-V4, LC3, and some others), but haven't tested it out. AptX adaptive for that matter definitely works.

2025-06-20T21:27:55Z
Don't think those have but edge 60 pro does and some other models as well

2025-06-21T05:30:50Z
Edge 50 pro does support LDAC

2025-06-24T16:21:47Z
Very good price.  
 I hope you enjoy it

2025-06-30T14:13:37Z
I bought the 60 fusion at the same price, moto is just good

2025-06-20T13:41:47Z
moto edge 50 fusion not included in the list, why ?

2025-06-20T12:28:13Z
They only require 3 Android updates? I thought there were more

2025-06-23T08:01:58Z
Edge 40 not available :(

2025-06-27T10:11:02Z
You have been chosen! 


For what you may ask - I have no idea, I'm sorry I'm just being silly today lol. I've never heard anyone else get a shirt randomly like that but maybe if you signed up for marketing materials or something when you made your order they sent it out.

2025-06-27T17:58:11Z
Hi u/SonarRonar, thank you for bringing this up. We understand how important it is to be safe from any scam, and we would like to look further into this. Could you tell us from which region you bought the phone and from what store you bought it? Did you receive any promotional emails from Motorola? Let us know so we can also verify this. -Carlos

2025-06-28T04:54:27Z
Hmm...

Good to see that by the way...

But without any info if you've received such stuff, it is not only you but whoever it may be they'll get goosebumps though...

2025-06-10T00:45:58Z
Since I'm Am-Prime I have their [Photos App](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16384500011) which works similarly, but if you want any replacement app that does not come with ads, search for FOSS apps. [Fossify apps](https://www.fossify.org/apps/) are some to test out.

2025-06-10T04:10:49Z
Aves is the best third party gallery app imo. I have been using it for a while and it's damn good

2025-06-10T04:38:35Z
Google photos is also good, this is the default on Moto phones.    
Or use this, or nothing: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photosgo

Anyone who wants to see the photos in high quality

2025-06-10T21:03:53Z
Could you share GCam link please?

2025-07-03T20:00:20Z
Silicone case + hydrogel screen film is the best combination for you

2025-07-03T20:08:58Z
It will not degrade the quality of the selfie camera.  
I only trust tempered glass.    
I've also put tempered glass protector rings on the normal cameras, and it doesn't affect the quality

2025-07-08T20:44:20Z
I have the exact same issue on my realme gt 6t as well. When I was researching this issue, it seemed sometime around android 12/13 there was a performance issue with custom launchers which needed some fixes that most manufacturers seem to not include. To my knowledge pixel & nothing phones don't have this performance issue, but xiaomi, realme, oneplus and most chinese OS'es seem to have this issue. Not sure about Samsung. 

I was actually hoping to get a moto for my next phone assuming it didn't have this issue, that's why I just joined this sub :) Apparently moto doesn't care about this either, it's so sad.

btw, if you switch to non-gesture based navigation (bottom bar for home, back etc), this issue might atleast partially disapper, pls try that out and let us know if it still has an issue when going back home or switching apps.

2025-07-09T01:29:38Z
Can you upload a video of your issue so that I can see what issue looks like, I use a lot of other launchers and never had an issue.

2025-07-09T11:10:24Z
I haven't had any issues with Nova Launcher on my Motorola Stylus 2025 model.

2025-06-17T08:03:35Z
Is it called "Always on display" in settings?

2025-06-29T17:54:57Z
Having owned the 60 fusion, I have absolutely no regrets. I have owned 3 Motorolas and currently I have the edge 60 pro. I think if you buy the 60 fusion you won't regret it. The autonomy is just crazy.

2025-06-29T04:54:49Z
G series is budget (g play is cheapest, then g, then g power, then g stylus)
Edge (followed by year) is mid-range. 
E series is literally not even entry. 
Edge (followed by number) depends based off the word that comes after that 
Razr is their flips.

2025-06-15T22:22:21Z
All depends on your model and the chipset  just like anything in life you get what you pay for  for instance if you have the Moto think phone or  The edge Plus 2023  you could game on them without issues because they got the hardware to back it up

2025-07-03T06:37:46Z
Actually is what you're looking for is a headphone TRRS  jack to USBC  when looking for a 3.5 to USB headphone jack adapter make sure it has trrs that one does both stereo audio and microphone. I know it works on the Motorola edge 2024 not sure about that motor edge 50. Because the Moto edge 50 has USB 2.0  The edge 2024 has USB 3.1 Gen 2

2025-07-02T10:18:33Z
Technically you can't just rip it out of the system or delete it but you're actually doing is disabling it and deleting it from the app drawer or app menu . On my Motorola I have a total of five apps that are totally disabled. And depending on if you have the unlocked version or a carrier version is going to depend on which apps you need to disable. For the good Motorola experience you got to aim high stay away from those budget devices

2025-06-13T08:40:52Z
its for stylus dude this app is for moto stylus

2025-06-13T08:51:58Z
You can download it here: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/motorola-mobility-llc/moto-note/moto-note-35-00-02-33-1-release/moto-note-35-00-02-33-1-android-apk-download/

But the Google keep is the best notes

2025-07-02T00:39:05Z
Where are you from, if you are in the US/Canada, there is a seperate range of phones sold. Global phones are sold everywhere else.

Chinese models may have a different name, but they share the same specs with the global phones.

The main difference is that the Chinese models do not have Google play services and the playstore on them, as Google does not operate in Mainland China.

You will have to unlock the bootloader to install the global room on a Chinese Motorola phone, and some apps won't work. It's possible to lock the bootloader, but there is a chance to brick the phone in the process. You will also have to do this for every update, as there will be no OTA updates.

Search on the Motorola website in your country for officially sold models and buy from those, unless you know what you are doing.

Hey edge 50 fusion(India) user here.

First things first.. 

About the updates. I've got around 4 security updates till now and 1 major android update. So in that case I can say that they are rolling out updates on time (can't say anything about other models too). 

Next is the battery section. If you are a normal user then the battery can last up to 1 whole day. And sometimes it can go up to 1.5 days too without charging. Battery drop is also not that significant. Watched a few episodes of a series yesterday for about 2-3 hrs and the battery went down from 100% to around 93%.. Next is the charging time.. it fully charges from around 40-55mins. 35-40 mins being on charge boost and 50-55 mins with the normal 68W battery. And in India, here is hot climate so the phone can heat up a bit while charging.

So this pretty sums up everything you have asked.

If you can go a bit further then go for 60 fusion. It's a good upgrade from 50 fusion with better display, battery, AI features and camera. And an additional android update too üòÖ

The news is there but there hasn't been any official statement regarding this. Maybe some phones had issues after rough usage, or when someone hampers the phone, or when someone uses non-genuine chargers. The reasons can be many so I can suggest that you wait for a few days or weeks if it is not urgent then you can go for the desired phone you need.

It's a charging bug and it will resolve on its own.I experienced this bug as well but after using the phone for a week it disappeared.

2025-06-20T13:17:32Z
I still have this problem after 3 weeks, I'm doing tests, but I have the impression that it only happens on my 125W charger

I wouldn't buy a Moto without Android 16 or Hello UI

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done that, but I think it‚Äôs an option when you first set up the phone the first time. Also, you can sync to google backup and have it all transfer that way.

2025-07-06T16:57:17Z
Yeah you can just use the google way, when you first launch the phone it ask if you want to transfer data from another phone, lets you choose apps, pictures, settings and so on. Pretty good and fast with me it took 25 min with a total of 38gb transferred. Around 100 apps and 20gb pictures and videos

you can buy it off Motorola website  but whether or not it's available is another thing you need to look for the 6.5A  3.3ft   USBC to USBC able  I actually have the Motorola oem part number for it if you need.

Motorola Essentials 6.5 Amp USB-C to USB-C Data/Charging Cable 3.3ft/1m Black (Part Number: ESSENTIALS65AMPUSBCTOUSBCDATA
 that's one expensive 125w PD CHARGING BLOCK it's about 100$ usd 
As far as the replacement charging cord you know you have the correct one if both USB type c ends are red

2025-06-30T15:27:06Z
When I went on the Motorola website it linked me to Amazon, this is where I bought it.

It does it automatically (100%) or is should but some claim their stops working.

At the other end of the scale that is not Auto, I let it discharge occasionally to give the battery cells a cycle as I am sick of my Moto phones (past 2) having near dead battery's after 2 years no matter how I care for them.

It will not matter soon as in 2027 all phones will have to have removable batteries like in the old days.

2025-06-25T17:46:08Z
For those people where it stopped working, disable Overcharge Protection, reboot your phone, then re-enable Overcharge Protection and reboot your phone again. 


Those are the instructions from Google Support, and they worked for me and my wife and co-workers.

2025-06-30T13:26:43Z
I used one. Android auto wont work. Updates are slower than international version. No resell value. Wont try again.

2025-07-01T04:52:35Z
It should be fine but Google services are wonky. The phone let's you record calls natively since it's not Google phone. You can add custom fonts and other interesting things

Bro it's a rebranded Edge 50 fusion. Leaked price for G96 is 20999. It's a POS, so you better buy Edge 50 fusion in discounted price like 17k something. Don't get fooled by Motorola

2025-07-04T16:58:24Z
You'll not get it probably .

Neo is better in my opinion cause I'm using it day to day and only issues is some minor UI bugs. My opinion is to go with Neo üòÅ

2025-06-20T08:39:30Z
Haptics are completely different on the Edge 60 Pro compared to the Edge 60 and Edge 60 Fusion.

The Edge 60 Pro has a more refined haptic engine that can give lots of variation in the vibrations. 

Whereas the Edge 60 and 60 Fusion use a simple coin vibrator, the same as the Edge 50 Pro and Neo.

Actual power is similar across all 3 though at full vibration, but the 60 Pro handles quick vibrations (like tapping on a keyboard) much better, and far better and the Edge 50 Pro or Neo.

2025-06-25T08:48:18Z
I have the same phone, and I've looked through all the camera settings and can't find a raw option. Just pro

2025-06-11T13:59:57Z
Did you toggle the button that says use sim

All those early features are limited to Samsung for some reason, not sure why as you would think it would be Google so Pixel's/Galaxy's.
