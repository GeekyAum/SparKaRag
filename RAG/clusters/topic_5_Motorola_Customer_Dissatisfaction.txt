No more Motorola phone!!!
But firstly I don't believe on amazon seller because motorola don't tie up with amazon
Your points are valid but it seems they have more to do with Hello UX from Motorola.
Check official Motorola site here, the price is updated regularly. There may be some small difference and the price quoted at the official store is final.
You can try online through motorola website to see official stores near you or call them up and ask. Like this i repaired my phone here
I'm organizing a massive protest against Motorola. Enough of them mocking us when all we do is give them our money.
U shouldn't buy Motorola
Just one example among thousands: https://www.reddit.com/r/motorola/s/aVFoUfa6vR
Damn, I'm getting scared by the number of defects in these Motorola devices.
I will never buy any Motorola or Lenovo device again.
Can't speak to ordering directly from their website but my experience of recent Motorola phones is very good.
I've not had luck with whatever flagship of the year they had, the last I owned was the Z series.  I've used their flagships maybe 10 years, continuously, upgrading from one to another, and always problems enough that I was about to switch to another brand.
Considering value Motorola does disappoint, recommend...
Motorolas have a lot of bang for their buck.
motorola has been going downhill since the global test for ricardo.
In Brazil, Motorola became synonymous with an unreliable product, precisely for this reason.
As a former Motorola user
Fuck you motorola.

Hi u/SonarRonar, thank you for bringing this up. We understand how important it is to be safe from any scam, and we would like to look further into this. Could you tell us from which region you bought the phone and from what store you bought it? Did you receive any promotional emails from Motorola? Let us know so we can also verify this. -Carlos
Search on the Motorola website in your country for officially sold models and buy from those, unless you know what you are doing.
you can buy it off Motorola website  but whether or not it's available is another thing you need to look for the 6.5A  3.3ft   USBC to USBC able  I actually have the Motorola oem part number for it if you need.
When I went on the Motorola website it linked me to Amazon, this is where I bought it.
Is Sanwaria Texpro Pvt Ltd the authorised reseller of Motorola mobile phones?? Is it safe to order phones thru them??? Has anyone of the viewers ordered phones thru them and is satisfied with their service? Kindly respond. Thanks!
This guy looks like a sellout for some reason. I think he was paid off by Motorola.

Never trusting your Motorola reviews again.
I love Motorola phone!
You forgot NFC. At this price point!!!
Motorola supremacy >>>
Overall good experience with Motorola.
Motorola is cooking fam
Also, for me another drawback is its ownership with Lenovo. The day Motorola becomes independent or has an Indian, US, European, Japanese or even a South Korean ownership, I will jump back to Motorola from Samsung or have both. Wish it becomes independent soon with all the Moto Glory back.
Motorola V/S Middle finger 😂
