What is more important for a phone in long run-processor or software? I'm asking this because I'm planning to buy a phone that can last at least 3 years. My budget is 25k but I can extend it upto 28k. And Realme gt 6t is coming which will probably launch around 28k with offers. So should I go with that or save few bucks and go with edge 50 fusion or nord ce4?
Why not compare with phone 2a aa well as Nord CE4
OnePlus you are talking about buddy comes with a ton of bloatware, which is really annoying. On the other hand, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion outshines OnePlus with its flawless 144Hz pOLED display. So, the con you're mentioning isn't really a con in this price range. By the way, I bought the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion for just 22K.
