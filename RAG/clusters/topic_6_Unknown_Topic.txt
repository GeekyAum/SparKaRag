No more Motorola phone!!!
"Motorola service center" visits are HELLA EXPENSIVE
it's either motorola's own website or Flipkart.
But firstly I don't believe on amazon seller because motorola don't tie up with amazon
Really feels like they're trying to shove this stuff down our throat to make your phone worse so you have to buy another. I've recommended motorola for the last 10-12 years, but never again. This user experience is about as good as malware, with that same "we only need to get lucky once" implied threat.
Your points are valid but it seems they have more to do with Hello UX from Motorola.
Check official Motorola site here, the price is updated regularly. There may be some small difference and the price quoted at the official store is final.
I'm organizing a massive protest against Motorola. Enough of them mocking us when all we do is give them our money.
U shouldn't buy Motorola
Just one example among thousands: https://www.reddit.com/r/motorola/s/aVFoUfa6vR
Can't speak to ordering directly from their website but my experience of recent Motorola phones is very good.
Always look at the specs that are IN your Country's Motorola website, that is the only reliable source of information for the specs. You can always check and compare the displayed info with CPU-Z once you get your device.
I've not had luck with whatever flagship of the year they had, the last I owned was the Z series.  I've used their flagships maybe 10 years, continuously, upgrading from one to another, and always problems enough that I was about to switch to another brand.
Considering value Motorola does disappoint, recommend...
Motorolas have a lot of bang for their buck.
Great phone in every way, only one problem with the sensitivity of the touchscreen and the recognition of finger Scanner. Probably a bug wich can be fixed with a update, hopefully Motorola do something about it very soon ...
motorola has been going downhill since the global test for ricardo.
As a former Motorola user
Fuck you motorola.

No, all Motorola phones won't have Bluetooth issues.
Search on the Motorola website in your country for officially sold models and buy from those, unless you know what you are doing.
you can buy it off Motorola website  but whether or not it's available is another thing you need to look for the 6.5A  3.3ft   USBC to USBC able  I actually have the Motorola oem part number for it if you need.
When I went on the Motorola website it linked me to Amazon, this is where I bought it.
Is Sanwaria Texpro Pvt Ltd the authorised reseller of Motorola mobile phones?? Is it safe to order phones thru them??? Has anyone of the viewers ordered phones thru them and is satisfied with their service? Kindly respond. Thanks!
This guy looks like a sellout for some reason. I think he was paid off by Motorola.
Motorola anthutu score 🤡👎🏻👎🏻
My 1st phone in motorola this year end.
Is compass supported for Motorola
NFC
This is my secondary phone next to my s23ultra. I can say that for mid range phone motorola has improved alot.
DONT BUY MOTOROLA. AFTERSALES IS RIDICULOUS!
What's more, Motorola's after-sales service is catastrophic. Their ‘technicians’ wasted an incredible amount of time for nothing. I had to do an initial reset, then another more thorough reset with their RSA software/procedure, and now they're asking me to send my phone in for repair when the problem is solely due to a bad update between their internal software and Android 14...
In short, for me Motorola is finished. Bye bye.
Which is best company for buy mobile between mi and motorola
Motorola is pure love!
Motorola becoming best in business 🎉❤
I work at Lenovo for Moto division. Trust me Motorola is levelling up their strategies as nobody. Motorola in the coming years will be hitting the top 3 spots.
