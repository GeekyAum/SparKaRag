No more Motorola phone!!!
"Motorola service center" visits are HELLA EXPENSIVE
it's either motorola's own website or Flipkart.
And motorola sells its official unit either on their own website or on flipkart
But firstly I don't believe on amazon seller because motorola don't tie up with amazon
Really feels like they're trying to shove this stuff down our throat to make your phone worse so you have to buy another. I've recommended motorola for the last 10-12 years, but never again. This user experience is about as good as malware, with that same "we only need to get lucky once" implied threat.
Your points are valid but it seems they have more to do with Hello UX from Motorola.
Check official Motorola site here, the price is updated regularly. There may be some small difference and the price quoted at the official store is final.
You can try online through motorola website to see official stores near you or call them up and ask. Like this i repaired my phone here
I'm organizing a massive protest against Motorola. Enough of them mocking us when all we do is give them our money.
U shouldn't buy Motorola
Just one example among thousands: https://www.reddit.com/r/motorola/s/aVFoUfa6vR
Damn, I'm getting scared by the number of defects in these Motorola devices.
I will never buy any Motorola or Lenovo device again.
Can't speak to ordering directly from their website but my experience of recent Motorola phones is very good.
Always look at the specs that are IN your Country's Motorola website, that is the only reliable source of information for the specs. You can always check and compare the displayed info with CPU-Z once you get your device.
Considering value Motorola does disappoint, recommend...
Motorolas have a lot of bang for their buck.
motorola has been going downhill since the global test for ricardo.
Classic Motorola feature
In Brazil, Motorola became synonymous with an unreliable product, precisely for this reason.
As a former Motorola user
Fuck you motorola.

No, all Motorola phones won't have Bluetooth issues.
Hi u/SonarRonar, thank you for bringing this up. We understand how important it is to be safe from any scam, and we would like to look further into this. Could you tell us from which region you bought the phone and from what store you bought it? Did you receive any promotional emails from Motorola? Let us know so we can also verify this. -Carlos
Search on the Motorola website in your country for officially sold models and buy from those, unless you know what you are doing.
you can buy it off Motorola website  but whether or not it's available is another thing you need to look for the 6.5A  3.3ft   USBC to USBC able  I actually have the Motorola oem part number for it if you need.
When I went on the Motorola website it linked me to Amazon, this is where I bought it.
Is Sanwaria Texpro Pvt Ltd the authorised reseller of Motorola mobile phones?? Is it safe to order phones thru them??? Has anyone of the viewers ordered phones thru them and is satisfied with their service? Kindly respond. Thanks!
This guy looks like a sellout for some reason. I think he was paid off by Motorola.
Motorola anthutu score 🤡👎🏻👎🏻
My 1st phone in motorola this year end.
Is compass supported for Motorola
NFC
This is my secondary phone next to my s23ultra. I can say that for mid range phone motorola has improved alot.
DONT BUY MOTOROLA. AFTERSALES IS RIDICULOUS!
What's more, Motorola's after-sales service is catastrophic. Their ‘technicians’ wasted an incredible amount of time for nothing. I had to do an initial reset, then another more thorough reset with their RSA software/procedure, and now they're asking me to send my phone in for repair when the problem is solely due to a bad update between their internal software and Android 14...
In short, for me Motorola is finished. Bye bye.
Which is best company for buy mobile between mi and motorola
Motorola is pure love!
Motorola becoming best in business 🎉❤
I work at Lenovo for Moto division. Trust me Motorola is levelling up their strategies as nobody. Motorola in the coming years will be hitting the top 3 spots.
Please Don't Buy anything from Motorola. Pathetic customer service. Horrible delivery partner.

Motorola phone future king 🗿🗿
*Some brand with whom we have nostalgic feelings...some did comeback with bang and some failed on the pursuit...Yes I'm talking about Motorola and Nokia!! Moto has been doing excellently good in the market since the launch of One Fusion+ launching one after one phones at competitive prices but here Nokia couldn't hold their feet!!!! And in these 3-4 years, I'm already using my second Moto... wish Nokia could also show some of their lost glories again!!!*

Worst company ever.. many problems in Motorola phone. Not getting all notifications on time.. too much delay in notifications.. All Motorola users are getting the same problem. Motorola is not listening.. very poor service.. don't buy Motorola brand Phones..you will regret it
Motorola rocks!!!! But they could have focused a little bit on perfomance, at least the antutu score should have been around 7 lakh
Lenovo is working hard to make Motorola the best selling phone.

Does this phone has magnetometer compass? I have a Motorola phone and it doesn't have compass. Using Google map is nightmare for me.
Never trusting your Motorola reviews again.
I love Motorola phone!
You forgot NFC. At this price point!!!
Motorola should improve their service center experience. Any issue with the phone it is going to be a terrible experience
Motorola is the only brand taking budget and midrange segments seriously..in india
Motorola supremacy >>>
I used Motorola phones from last 15 Plus yrs, Nice and sturdy phone to day to day use.
Overall good experience with Motorola.
Motorola is cooking fam
Also, for me another drawback is its ownership with Lenovo. The day Motorola becomes independent or has an Indian, US, European, Japanese or even a South Korean ownership, I will jump back to Motorola from Samsung or have both. Wish it becomes independent soon with all the Moto Glory back.
Motorola V/S Middle finger 😂
We always support to Motorola ❤❤❤
Motorola is always King 👑👑👑👑
IPhone best, capture all , motorola ignore
