Suggest some aesthetic theme for my 50 fusion ...
If updates are a necessity for you, don't switch to edge 50 fusion. For all the other requirements I would have definitely switched to edge 50 fusion.
Fusion.
The edge 50 fusion by far
What about for Edge 50 fusion?
I repaired my 50 fusion for 7k for the display along with front panel. I had only one official service center in my city.
But 2 things seperate them. 50 ultra has 64mp telephoto lens vs 60 pro has 8mp. Ultra can record better video vs pro. But pro 60 haa better battery life with 6000mah and ultra has 4500. So you choose what's more important to you while the price difference is nearly 17k.
I have the edge 60 pro and it is excellent in all areas. I recommend it to you.
60 Pro is a mid-range
And please don't compare this with the Edge 60 Pro. They are for different people.
The edge 50 series is a good choice depending on the model definitely stick with the pro or the ultra

Hey edge 50 fusion(India) user here.
Haptics are completely different on the Edge 60 Pro compared to the Edge 60 and Edge 60 Fusion.
The Edge 60 Pro has a more refined haptic engine that can give lots of variation in the vibrations.
Actual power is similar across all 3 though at full vibration, but the 60 Pro handles quick vibrations (like tapping on a keyboard) much better, and far better and the Edge 50 Pro or Neo.
