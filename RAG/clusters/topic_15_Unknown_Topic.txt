CAMERA:-
It's my personal opinion don't sacrifice battery Life for a good camera you'll regret. Find some different options.
It still has the best camera setup in this price range tbh if you want an all rounder camera then go for it otherwise don't... Battery okiesh I get around 5-6 sot on moderate use till 20% but sometimes it drains battery a lot maybe cuz of heat
I really like the auto enhance feature for the camera, a lot of people complain about the camera, but I really like it
* **Design & space:** It frees up room for other components like bigger batteries or advanced cameras.
Tip: use the "pro" mode on the camera, if the main camera makes too many changes to the photos. and for selfies I only use pro mode.
I will say the cameras are a bit limited, but they're not terrible.
Glad i use open camera
Anyone who wants to see the photos in high quality
It will not degrade the quality of the selfie camera.

Bro. How is the total usage, the battery, the storage and camera performance
+Great camera, has in-built sony lYTIA 700C which helps you capture colourful and sharp portrait pictures at f1.8 aperture, has great stabilization and good videography capabilities. Front camera is good with AI beauty feature. Shockingly can record at 4k quality at 0.5 wide angle and 60 fps as usual is smooth.
-Camera- after turning the stabilization mode on, the camera quality gets a bit grainy which happens but without stabilization mode, it still gets grainy.
