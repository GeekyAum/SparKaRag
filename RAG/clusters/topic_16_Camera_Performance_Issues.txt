CAMERA:-
It's my personal opinion don't sacrifice battery Life for a good camera you'll regret. Find some different options.
It still has the best camera setup in this price range tbh if you want an all rounder camera then go for it otherwise don't... Battery okiesh I get around 5-6 sot on moderate use till 20% but sometimes it drains battery a lot maybe cuz of heat
I really like the auto enhance feature for the camera, a lot of people complain about the camera, but I really like it
Tip: use the "pro" mode on the camera, if the main camera makes too many changes to the photos. and for selfies I only use pro mode.
I will say the cameras are a bit limited, but they're not terrible.
Have you see any change in camera?
Anyone who wants to see the photos in high quality
It will not degrade the quality of the selfie camera.

Bro. How is the total usage, the battery, the storage and camera performance
-Camera- after turning the stabilization mode on, the camera quality gets a bit grainy which happens but without stabilization mode, it still gets grainy.
I would rate it 9/10. This is made for gamers and minor photography/videography and for normal activities as well. Go for it :)
