I don't why but this SoT feature should be available on all moto devices irrespective to model& region.
AFAIK, Amazon is not an Authorised Store for Moto in India
Moto is just simple, no heavy skins and BS apps in it though...
And why would you need a volume button double click for camera - moto gestures with shaking and chopping are so good...
Wow, the back of the Moto One is very nice.
Just stay on iphone. U gonna regret it. Moto user here
Honestly no, don't do that switching from a flagship lvl phone to 'Moto' isn't really the best choice. The updates are awful and there are bugs that could actually ruin your entire experience of using the phone. Go for some other device. Save yourself and don't use Motorola.
You deserve neither samsung nor moto
Though they offer great VFM, Moto phones are notoriously famous for having issues in long term usage.
Moto had these problems since long time and it Just ruins the whole experience.
Welcome to the moto club
Moto's downfall started before reaching peak 🥲
Fuck whore company moto.
Buy Moto
Better Don't switch because your phone feel laggy just perform factory reset then everything fix.. unless if you have plenty of money don't know what to do then buy moto
I was actually hoping to get a moto for my next phone assuming it didn't have this issue, that's why I just joined this sub :) Apparently moto doesn't care about this either, it's so sad.
I wouldn't buy a Moto without Android 16 or Hello UI
Bhya I'm looking for buy nothing 2a but you said moto is better so I'm confused can you suggest me one 😢plz
Moto is Mahindra of smartphones.........while lot features under budget. Build quality top notch 💪🏻❣️
Moto's phone = 🤡
Moto's ad=💀
I am using moto g52 past 2 year by your recommendation and I love it best phone in my life
Is there any feature in moto G62 5G that before switching off it requires Password ?
Don't buy moto phones my moto g62 got dead in 15 months and even service centre couldn't help it.15k wasted 😢
I am requesting you please this message that please produce brick design phones like nothing, samsung and apple. I big fan of moto also doing very good job. we moto lover also want boxy design very soon.. please pass msg to Moto if you have reach. thank you 🙏🙏
Don't buy Moto! It's an Israeli company.
MOTO is going HIGHHH...
Moto g34
Moto mobile good 🤳 but SAR value is so hi😢
Moto should do 2 things
Which phones is bttr overall in moto between
Moto moto moto moto .............
Worst smartphone moto only having online market zero offline market
moto phones are good .am using my 3rd moto phone.the only prb iam facing with moto is no timely security update no camera update no android update timely.still running in Android 13 for a brand new Mobile,they promised for 3 yrs of Android update but nothing came till.and customer support and service centres are really a myth.they just collaborate with local shops.
Slowly my family is shifting to moto 😂
In 2006 - 07 moto was a top brand with beautiful phones after so many years can say moto is really back with a bang
One time will come when moto will lead the indian market
Moto phone is not good phone
Moto is very bad phone company
Moto is good from past..
Moto always rock's ⚖️🎼🎼
Killer all brands best off best moto
Prevent buying Moto phones specially ones under 20k. The brand claims a lot about the phone features, like back in 2022 they made bold claims of "True 5g" and the don't even support 5g+ on those phones. The main reason you should not buy is the lack of security updates. Moto claims security updates for 3years and above, but they stop securtiy patch updates within 2 years.
Moto vs nothing 2a conparison
I have moto g 34 which I got in 11k only and when I ask someone to guess the price they say probably 15-16 k (I feel proud ) nobody has guessed the price accurately till now😂
Dont buy moto...ye phone sirf papers p hi ache h...reality m ghatiya h
Moto is great but they have major drawback when it comes to customer care
What about moto service centre?
Moto kill the market because all brand doing c** in cost cutting features
Respect how Moto is changing itself every month 🙌💯
I think moto is going to be a next Samsung
Moto will take place on third after apple and Samsung .....
Customer care of moto is 11th wonder of world
MOTO  😎😎😎
Moto is killing smartphone market 🔥🔥🔥
Yess definitely I will buy this..... comment from moto g5s plus
Moto may be slaying the market with specs and price but over a long run the phones from MOTO are painful affairs
My yt is filled with Moto ad
Moto is going for the kill this time.
As a moto fan this should have been on 7gen 3
who used moto phones are basically wants three Performance, Stock android experience and battery life these are thing moto users are look for
Moto is breaking record in every price segment ❤
absolutely moto doing great but motorola should have bring a smartphone with notification led or glyph light like other
They do launch good phone. But, don’t have dedicated Moto shop-app.
Else moto is rising
always facing lot of problems in moto mobiles i hate moto always, above video says top 5 in 1 year in sales lol not possible
Moto is 🔥 23k too good ❤
Moto 💩
I have been using a moto phone for about 6-7 months and they are doing amazing
moto is rocking !!🔥🔥
Now moto only needs to improve there customer support and services. Else everything is now perfect ❤
Lol Apple, Samsung and Pixel should learn from moto. I've seen people tolerating and sacrificing features just for the symbols and brands.
Really moto is doing great 👍
I think moto would release gaming centric phones too
The killer , the once mi note and realme number series is now overtaken by moto !!! 🔥🔥🔥
everything is okay until you have bought 3 moto phones and all have that speaker problem within 6 months 😏
New moto(lenovo)👎🤬
Moto is the powerfull phone ❤😊😊
